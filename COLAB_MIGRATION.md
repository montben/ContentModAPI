# 🚀 Colab Migration Guide

Your ContentModAPI project is perfectly set up for Google Colab! Here's how to migrate and start training.

## Migration Options

### Option 1: GitHub + Colab (Recommended)
**Best for:** Version control, sharing, and collaboration

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/benmontgomery/Documents/ContentModAPI
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ContentModAPI.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Open in Colab:**
   - Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
   - File → Open notebook → GitHub tab
   - Enter: `yourusername/ContentModAPI`
   - Open `notebooks/colab_setup.ipynb`

### Option 2: Google Drive Upload
**Best for:** Quick start, large datasets

1. **Upload project:**
   - Compress your project: `zip -r ContentModAPI.zip /Users/benmontgomery/Documents/ContentModAPI`
   - Upload to Google Drive
   - Extract in Drive

2. **Open in Colab:**
   - Upload `notebooks/colab_setup.ipynb` to Drive
   - Right-click → Open with → Google Colaboratory

## What You Get in Colab

### ✅ Advantages
- **Free GPU/TPU** - T4 GPU with 16GB RAM (much faster than local CPU)
- **12GB RAM** - Handle larger datasets and models
- **Pre-installed libraries** - Most ML packages already available
- **Persistent storage** - Save models to Drive
- **Easy sharing** - Share notebooks with collaborators

### 📊 Your Project Status
- **Data Collection**: ✅ Complete (5 datasets ready)
- **Preprocessing**: ✅ Ready (label schema defined)
- **Training Pipeline**: ✅ Ready (BERT fine-tuning script)
- **Notebooks**: ✅ Created (setup + training notebooks)

## Quick Start Steps

1. **Choose migration method** (GitHub recommended)
2. **Run setup notebook** (`colab_setup.ipynb`)
3. **Run training notebook** (`colab_training.ipynb`)
4. **Download trained model** back to local

## Training Time Estimates

With Colab GPU:
- **Data loading**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Model training**: ~15-30 minutes (depends on data size)
- **Total pipeline**: ~45 minutes

## File Structure for Colab

```
ContentModAPI/
├── notebooks/
│   ├── colab_setup.ipynb      ← Start here
│   └── colab_training.ipynb   ← Then this
├── data/datasets/             ← Your collected data
├── scripts/                   ← Your training code
└── artifacts/                 ← Saved models
```

## Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub** or **upload to Drive**
2. **Open colab_setup.ipynb** in Colab
3. **Follow the notebook** step by step
4. **Train your model** with GPU acceleration!

The migration is seamless because your code is already well-structured and modular. 🎉
