# Muzzle - AI Content Moderation API

This project provides a FastAPI-based microservice that uses machine learning to moderate text and images for toxicity, hate speech, and inappropriate content.

## Overview

The Muzzle platform is an AI-powered content moderation system that enables automated screening of user-generated content. The system allows applications to integrate content moderation capabilities through REST API endpoints that can handle text analysis, image classification, and batch processing of content.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.11 or later
- PostgreSQL database (Docker setup provided)
- Redis server (for async processing)

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

**Set up environment:**
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration
# At minimum, set DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL
```

**Run development server:**
```bash
# Start the API server
python3 -m uvicorn muzzle.main:app --reload

# Or using Docker Compose (includes PostgreSQL and Redis)
docker-compose -f deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

**Access the application:**
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health
- API Base: http://localhost:8000/api/

## API Endpoints

**Text Moderation:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/moderate/text" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Your text content here"}'
```

**Image Moderation:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/moderate/image" \
  -F "image=@path/to/your/image.jpg"
```

## Technology Stack

- **FastAPI** - Modern Python web framework with automatic API documentation
- **Pydantic** - Data validation and settings management
- **SQLAlchemy** - Database ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Redis + Celery** - Async task processing for batch operations
- **HuggingFace Transformers** - Pre-trained ML models (DistilBERT for text)
- **PyTorch** - Deep learning framework for custom models
- **Docker** - Containerization for development and deployment

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Run tests
python3 -m pytest

# Run linting
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/
mypy src/

# Start development server
python3 -m uvicorn muzzle.main:app --reload

# Docker development environment
docker-compose -f deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml up

# Run database migrations (when implemented)
alembic upgrade head
```

## Current Status

**âœ… Completed:**
- Project structure and configuration
- Basic FastAPI application with health endpoints
- Mock API endpoints for text and image moderation
- Docker development environment
- Basic testing setup

**ðŸ”„ In Progress:**
- API endpoint organization and validation
- Configuration management improvements

**ðŸ“‹ Planned:**
- ML model integration (DistilBERT, NSFW classifiers)
- Database models and migrations
- Async processing with Celery
- Authentication and rate limiting
- Comprehensive testing suite

## Component Relationships

The main FastAPI application (`main.py`) serves as the entry point and includes routers from the `api/endpoints/` directory. The `core/config.py` manages all application settings loaded from environment variables. The `services/` directory will contain the ML model inference logic, while `db/` handles data persistence. The `deployment/docker/` setup provides a complete development environment with PostgreSQL and Redis.

## Development Approach

This project is being built incrementally with a focus on learning and understanding each component. Each major feature is implemented step-by-step with thorough testing and documentation.

For detailed information about specific components, refer to their respective README files in each directory.
