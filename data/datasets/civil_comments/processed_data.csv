Second, every Canadian is represented in the HoC via their local MP - MPs serve all of their constituents and their constituency, not just those who voted for them.

"The ""wrong"" if you want to call it that regards two problems in the urban environment, the growing urban heat island + increased urban storm runoff on impervious surfaces. Both cause problems for city dwellers. Our cities  hotter than nearby less developed areas, increasing electrical costs by all users. Storm runoff requires infrastructure to manage even small storm events, driving up costs to taxpayers. Mitigating these with green roofs would benefit the health + pocketbooks of the taxpayers + it makes sense to offer incentives to developers + building owners as well. Other benefits could include ones I mentioned previously; an increase in livable space, such as parks,community gardens + urban farms atop certain structures. Chicago, New York + much of Europe is decades ahead of us on this concept.

"Frank: The NFL game guide reads ""The National Anthem must be played prior to every NFL game, and all players must be on the sideline for the National Anthem""

then, from Pro Football Talk....""While the NFL has no in-game rule on conduct for the anthem, they have commented on the matter. According to Pro Football Talk, the NFL released a statement saying that ""players are encouraged but not required to stand during the playing of the National Anthem.""

It looks like the National Anthem MUST be played prior to games....that's a stated rule. However, while players MUST be on the sidelines, the reference to ""player behavior during the anthem"" is prefaced by the word ""should""....that's a very big difference. It doesn't read like ""taking a knee"" is a violation of any NFL rule. Clearly it's contrary to the recommended player behavior, but that's a different thing.

"Economic policy is more complicated than that. Regan had the second highest government spending as % of GDP of any recent president, 21.6% of GDP. Second only to Obama and not by much. He nearly tripled the Federal debt in dollar terms and as a % of GDP it went from 26% to 41%. Household debt almost doubled during the Regan administration. 

Inflation during his administration was around 62%. 

Regan's first act reduced taxes. His second TEFRA--while not increasing income tax--was one of the largest tax increases in history. Regan's own administration estimated that taxes were 19.4% of GDP while the historic average was 18.3%. 

Regan was not a free market economist. He followed the same Keynesian strategy that FDR and LBJ did. He just painted it better.

Given the above, we could close the gap with one fell swoop - We legislate that all Canadian children must be in institutional care starting at 6 weeks old.  We will pay the workers in these institutions (Presumably the new mom's who aren't stuck at home anymore) $10,000 a month.

Voila.  Gap solved.  Never mind that we're ripping babes out of their mothers arms to do it, and closing the wage gap by paying a fortune for institutionalized care.

"During the Wojtyla/Ratzinger years, we witnessed a gradual, but not subtle, emergence of a new ultramontanism that is aptly called ""creeping"" (creepy!) infallibility. Infallibility was often invoked (not always explicitly) in a way that tends to collapse the traditional articulation of distinct levels of authority and response. For instance, Pope John Paul never explicitly invoked infallibility to shore up his teaching about the ordination of women; neither did Pope Benedict. But Cardinal Ratzinger, as prefect of the CDF, did; in doing so, Ratzinger did not in any respect add to or detract from what JP had already written. 
I bring this up to argue that this fuzzy way of thinking about church teaching, about authority, response and reception of church teaching, about conscience formation has a provenance in recent papacies.

However, Catherine opposed the annulment, probably because she didn't want her daughter Mary to lose her place as Henry's heir. So she claimed that she  had never consummated her marriage to Arthur. She also got her nephew, Charles II, to oppose the annulment. Charles, who disliked Henry both personally and politically, was happy to oblige his aunt.

Among other things, Charles was King of Naples. Naples and the Papal States had recently had a war. The pope lost, and didn't want a rerun. So he pretended to take Catherine's claim seriously.

The practicalities were fudged in the UK and that is something that they will have to work through (TEC were not as hidebound and led the way) - they are still working with the fallout as the 'evangelical' (protestant) wing are still very much against the ordination of women (because women must not teach men, not because they cannot administer sacraments) and, now, gay marriage.

"@Philly_Canuck -- quote "" I suspect that such limits may exist (thought experiment: What happens if you triple it overnight?)""

This is a great question.  If we take the US examples cited, in many cases there was minimal to no negative impact on working hours, though there was some correlation between the increase in minimum wage and a decrease in job formation.

At some point, if the minimum wage is high enough, it's a virtual certainty that there is a significant impact (i.e. if minimum wage became $50/hour).

So somewhere in between, presumably is a 'sweet spot' that maximizes the overall benefit while minimizing the downsides.  This could be a range of ratios relative to median incomes for example.  (a good start for a Masters' thesis if any aspiring economists are so inclined).

I'd hypothesize that the US results were more a function of the real minimum wage still being less than historical norms, even with the increases -- ergo limited job market impact.  To be determined...",civil_comments,sample_3131,False,False,False,False,False,False,"0,0,0,0,0,0"

"simply because you have cancer doesn't give you a free reign to distort my point about pain. There are two ways that some people respond here...""exception proves the rule""...and ""my condition proves the rule"". 2 for 2.

Read Salvifici Dolores to better understand the proper Christian understanding of pain, which is at great variance from your view. 

There is a spectrum of pain & Church teaching accommodates all points in the spectrum beautifully.  None of my points depart from this teaching. 

Some forms of ""ordinary pain"" (getting up, common colds, twisted ankles,  applying exactitude to finish a job well, sore necks, stiff backs, tingly fingers from stenosis, etc.) are perfect examples where a Christian can brace up a bit, & draw closer to union with Jesus in that moment of pain.    Offering the little pain for reparation, in thanksgiving, etc.

It takes a bit of practice; but the intimacy with Christ is dear. 

More extraordinary pain can be managed with prudent use of pallitatives",civil_comments,sample_3393,False,False,False,False,False,False,"0,0,0,0,0,0"

One example: A prisoner, I know, has been tortured many times by the prison medical system. No pain relief and dental work denied for years! Recently, he won his right to have his pain medication re-instated after they were arbitrarily taken away. He was almost invalided, for over a year because it took that long for his case to wind through the grievance system and court. Another prisoner was not allowed to go home to die!

In reading (and rereading) his article, there's something really troubling to me.  In the article, Gustafson talks about  the ""four significant dimensions to recovery.""  They are External Accountability (conviction, in his case), Internal Responsibility (it's not the victim's fault), Therapy, and finally internalizing all this to change oneself.

Note that the entire focus here is on the abuser's recovery.  Note also that this ""conclusion"" by Gustafson comes from the help provided him, presumably with significant church guidance and funding.   

The missing part here is doing anything for the victim.  Is that not a basic tenet of AA, or other similar programs?    I can't get this thought out of my mind: this guy has been rehabbed, and has a story to tell, likely with episcopal support.

They think giving homeless people better options is worth real money, since otherwise they simply congregate and camp in public areas.  Policing them isn't effective (ties up too much manpower).  Pushing them out just moves the problem elsewhere.  And, though it may disappoint you, a Darwinian solution isn't available; we can't let people simply die on our streets.

The first reason housing is so effective is that it disperses a population that otherwise has little choice but to hang out together wherever they are tolerated. The second is that housing gives otherwise hopeless people a motive to start taking better care of themselves.  A third is that housing keep children off the streets and out of cars; even a Darwinian should be able to see the point of saving children.",civil_comments,sample_3694,False,False,False,False,False,False,"0,0,0,0,0,0"

  The right and left do indeed exist, the form an ideological spectrum where the center, generally speaking, reflects the views held by the majority.  The right tends to express a desire to either return things to a so-called golden age or to preserve the status quo.

* the impact of the sexual revolution, particularly on psychosexually immature men, whose sexual immaturity and deprivation led to distorted cognitive thinking about children and whose repressed sexual curiosity led to greater sexual experimentation;
* the greater general turbulence in the Catholic Church during and immediately after the Second Vatican Council, with the celibacy debate masking the deeper crisis about the role of the priest
* ‘Young priests unilaterally abandoned the obligation to remain celibate, while some people opted for the priesthood in the expectation it would be abolished’, leading to a conscious rejection of the celibacy rules by many clergy.

""Springfield also is looking at ... including lifting a requirement that the property owner has to live on site and one that requires on-site parking be paved.""

This is a terribly misguided contorting of the ""accessory"" dwelling concept.

"""Rape is an outrage that cannot be tolerated in a civilized society."" ~ Camille Paglia

Does that statement, by implication, mean that other forms of assault are not an outrage?

In my view, rape and other forms of sexual assault mustn't be viewed in a fundamentally different manner than other assaults. ALL assaults are a violation of an individual's physical and emotional well-being. For example, an unwanted slap on a woman's behind is a sexual assault. Is that a worse offence than slapping a man on the face? Which hurts more? Which is more demeaning?

Women are often victims of sexual assault. Feminists have drawn attention to that problem by claiming that it's a particularly pernicious form of assault. In doing so they've taken attention away from physical assault, which men experience at far higher rates than women.

The problem won't be fixed one gender at a time. No form of assault against anyone is acceptable, and all forms of assault must be condemned equally.",civil_comments,sample_4378,False,False,False,False,False,False,"0,0,0,0,0,0"

"Eugene has successful models for transitional  and emergency homeless shelter, Opportunity Village and the ""rest stop"" camps, all run by local nonprofits using city or county land. These could be expanded, but the problem is neighborhood opposition. So the neighborhoods end up with messy illegal unorganized homeless camps instead of organized legal ones, and then constantly complain about it. The homeless are not going to suddenly disappear so it would make more sense to provide legal shelter. 

It is also cheaper, when you consider all the money that goes into policing, courts, jails, ER visits, park cleaning, etc. This has been proven in other cities that have adopted a ""housing first"" policy of providing subsidized housing with no preconditions, such as treatment for addictions or mental illness, but provided those as supports for people who want them.
