"""Blueberry, I do not need to be on council to answer your question number 4 with ""Yes"", and number 5 with, ""

Hi Chad,

So if you could just clarify a bit please.   If I understand your answer for question 5, it sounds to me as though in the case of our local PD specifically, that over-site is not required because they already have a strong positive track record serving Kent WA?

""And while government has killed more person in history than all of the criminals of the world combined, so has fire.""

 I would only add that unlike government, fire has no conscience in which to be able to be malevolent or benevolent, nor has the ability to be manipulative or hold any desire to rule over people: and while it maybe true today that the Kent PD is good, it may not be true tomorrow.

My fault should have been paying attention and that's what I told the local police officer who gave me the ticket.

He asked was I not watching the highway signs it clearly says HOV? His next question was so funny I laughed so hard he asked me what did you think HOV stand for Hawaiians orientals and visitors?

That would be nice. But since most SDA  people tend to be conventional/institutional and/or carnal/worldly, it is not the case. Do a survey at your church and see if more than 10% have ever read the bible through once. See what % even look at their SS lesson. See what % will want to read 42 chapters of Job before the end of the year. I just read that the ""Desire of Ages"" is the most popular book of SDA. See what % have ever read it once.
See what % of SDA in your church have ever read ""Steps to Christ""..a book that is less than 100 pages.

""Counting mass shootings that make headlines and the thousands of Americans murdered one or a few at a time, gunshot homicides totaled 8,124 in 2014, according to the F.B.I.

This level of violence makes the United States an extreme outlier when measured against the experience of other advanced countries.

Around the world, those countries have substantially lower rates of deaths from gun homicide. In Germany, being murdered with a gun is as uncommon as being killed by a falling object in the United States. About two people out of every million are killed in a gun homicide. Gun homicides are just as rare in several other European countries, including the Netherlands and Austria. In the United States, two per million is roughly the death rate for hypothermia or plane crashes. "".....(cont)",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I suspect one of the many reasons international students represent such a nice cohort for post-secondary institutions is that these people don`t need remedial assistance.  Not even English literacy.

Storm runoff requires infrastructure to manage even small storm events, driving up costs to taxpayers. Mitigating these with green roofs would benefit the health + pocketbooks of the taxpayers + it makes sense to offer incentives to developers + building owners as well. Other benefits could include ones I mentioned previously; an increase in livable space, such as parks,community gardens + urban farms atop certain structures.

"Hillary has peaked.  The remaining states have fewer votes for Hillary, and Bernie is gaining momentum, she's the hare and Bernie's the tortoise.  Your delusions that it wasn't Democrats voting for Sanders here are just that, because I knew in advance from talking to many Democrats in my district that they were going to come and caucus for Bernie, who is more of a Democrat than the Republican Lite Hillary.  Bernie's positions have always been consistent, while hers vary depending on who she's trying to convince to vote for her.  Not only will Bernie be the nominee, but poll after poll shows that he can beat either Trump or Cruz by much higher margins than she can, and his margins are high enough that he'll have strong  coattails, helping to take back Congressional and Senate seats.  He will be elected by the fed up, who have given more in small donations than Hillary has raised from Wall $treet banksters and the other billionaires who are stealing us blind.",0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.0
"Aislin, if you want to follow the organization of JWs then of course that is your right and I really don't care either way.  Good for you. But I have heard your arguments and they are not persuasive in the least to me. In fact you gloss over the list of mistakes and terrible history in such a way that shows you are not even open minded. In other words you have bene brainwashed, in my sincere opinion. Just like I was. 

Remember, I have been on both sides of the JW world now. I was one for 15 years and was an elder too. I gave dozens of public talks, chaired conventions, was Kingdom ministry school conductor, book study conductor, did watchtower conducting many times, on numerous judicial committees and everything else that comes with being a stand-up JW. 

But when one really wants the truth in their life you have to be willing to truly examine all things.

This is what I have done. And today I am at true peace. I love where I am at today.

Canadians have long fuses and are a fair-minded people. He's totalled his brand.

"Many of us who live on the lower Cook Inlet remember this somewhat differently. We observed humpback whales staying in our waters later than anyone could ever remember seeing; through September, October, into November, and many until the first of the year. There were extraordinary numbers of murres as well, staying well past the traditional time when this species would migrate from the region.

These creatures didn't linger because there was a lack of food, on the contrary, there was a tremendous amount of food, and temperatures were unseasonably warm. Those of us who took to the water (from Koyuktolic Bay to the head of Kachemak) saw tremendous balls of bait  fish.

These bait fish often leave our waters as quickly as they arrive. In less than a week's time, early November, a great preponderance of these balls of bait left the area. The murres had stayed too long. A heavy 80 knot wind hit the area and caught the birds unawares. Blowing them inland all the way to Lake Illiamna.",0.16666667,0.0,0.16666667,0.0,0.16666667,0.0,0.0

I'd describe Trump more as non-Christian, based on his behavior and the values he's espoused both personally and politically. I believe Trump is mainly about self-interest and only uses religiosity as a means to get what he wants.
