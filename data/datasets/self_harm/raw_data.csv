But I don't know if I can take 50 more years of this shit, every day it gets harder to get out of bed. All I have are regrets and resentment, and with the proper method, my chances of waking up are pretty slim, probably slim enough to risk it.

Now, realistically, you have options. Legal options and (depending on how you feel about the justice system) things can and will be done. But in that instant when you realized it, if not from then on, you would feel broken. You would want to kill that person who took everything away from you. Even if you didn't have the means, and even if you never did anything but call the cops, you would think ""what I would do to get my hands on that son of a bitch.""
But what if it's you? What if you took everything from your home and took your family out of their beds, leaving yourself with nothing? What if you didn't even realize it until after it was done?

I brought three vhs tapes because I threw away my VCR.  (Goodwill bythepound is what I requested, the vcr just needed the door ripped off or reset, I didn't look too close.)  Two were anime, one has a show I'd like to replace.  Geeze, I was trying to explain to mom how it wasn't as emotionally draining as she described it (closet*) by bringing up Labyrinth.... I had to request that she not scream like the last time I opened the media cabinet, I think it still would have been worth the effort to make the phone youtube to the chromecast.  (I don't know what was wrong with the chromecast, but the new ones are larger.) My fault, but mom has a vhs copy of Labyrinth.  Mom screaming about the media cabinets was because they were cheap flatpack and drunkenly opening them wrong would make a VHS mess.

Closet*, I think I dismissed all of my girlscout stuff, i kept a little of my school stuff, so two milkboxes gone.  (Sams club used to package two gallons of milk in boxes.)  I had a tote of toys already marked as mom's problem, but I went through it and added some to my keep tote again.  

I made my entire teacup collection mom's property.  There was this bowl that grandpaL gave to me and wasn't his style, he must have bought it for the sake of browsing an antique store, sorta the point of my teacup collection... While rummaging the china cabinet to make a space, I encountered a teacup with a pricetag that indicated that I probably foisted part of my collection on mom the very day i got it.  Now the bowl is going to be there until both of us forget why it's in the china cabinet.

FFS, my comic books from, 1997 survived because of plastic totes and I don't know which ones to prune.  At least the dishes were easy.  I'm keeping the stupid duck casserole, but other things went.  

What I came here to rant about was the art supplies.  I had a plastic drawer full of Crayola markers from late 1990's.  Early 2000's was when I told my mom to do something about them.  She put the markers in a shoebox and stored CD's in the drawers... I know you can revive crayola markers by dipping them in water, or send them to the factory for recycling.... I sent those fuckers to the landfill because I felt miserable when I tried to use them.  Don't shame me for thinking of us instead of the environment.  

There are also Testor bottles with 15C stamped on the top, and fabric paints that are 20 years old. I told her to get rid of them, but into the art fodder they go to mold.

I get no pleasure from pretty much anything except for eating, and even then, there's guilt attached to it because I don't need the weight gain... Honestly, my life has been a trainwreck, and I feel so alone/isolated that it brings me near constant despair. I don't really see any way of actually changing any of the circumstances in my life, and that doesn't help how I feel, either; even my therapist and psychiatrist are stumped on how I could actually turn things around. I've been a shut-in ever since I graduated high school back in 2013, and I can't even go out in public without needing to cling to my mom as a security blanket. I know how pathetic I am.   


1. My parents kept me isolated while growing up; not on purpose, but rather more because of the fact that they never have socialized themselves all that much and viewed it as a bother if me or my sister wanted to go visit someone from school, for example. They never felt a need to do it themselves, so they thought we didn't need it, either. What this more or less amounted to was that I never really had a chance to develop a proper foundation in terms of socializing.
2. My family has had money issues the majority of my life, and the stress it's caused has been the cause of many arguments, in addition to the other worries associated with not having a lot of money. It helped (though not alone in doing so) give me an aversion to confrontation. 
3. My father had always had a very severe temper. He would yell and scream   and curse at us for things that nowhere warranted that kind of reaction. He'd throw things, turn tables over, pull out a weapon, etc. I didn't feel safe when he was at home and not at work, and I felt as though I constantly had to walk on eggshells.
4. I  had to struggle with accepting being trans, and that struggle was only worsened by the fact that my family was pretty hardcore anti-LGBT while I  was growing up. My dad said we wouldn't have a home if we were even just gay, so I could only assume that being trans would be received with the same anger or worse. 
5. I   live in (and grew up in) a very backwards, conservative area. Most   people aren't very accepting around here, and there's very little diversity. The area itself is also very rural. very small, and generally   very poor, having no opportunities of any kind.
6. In an effort to hide being trans, I convinced myself into being someone   that I wasn't. Most people didn't like this persona, and it led to...
7. Frequent bullying, and me becoming bitter/angry in response. My reaction only made people hate me even more.
8. I had no relationship with my family at all as I climbed into my teenage   years, and I also didn't have any friends. The bitterness and anger eventually gave way to self-hate, depression, and giving up with people   in general.
9. In high school, the bullying gradually started to cease, but it gave way to people pretty much ignoring my existence. I spent most of my time   alone, which was very hurtful. My anxiety just kept worsening as I   drifted further and further into complete isolation.
10. I reached the point with my dad where he would just randomly come and pick fights with me, and it often resulted in saying things like ""I want to haunt you after I die"", I don't want you at my funeral"", ""don't  call  me dad anymore"". It was very hurtful and scary. Our relationship has improved since then, but i'll never be able to forget all of those   things that already happened.
11. I've continued to remain friendless ever since graduation, and the closest thing I ever had to a real friend (which lasted for maybe two months) abandoned me without even saying why.
12. I have to carry with and deal with the general societal stigma that  being  trans gives me. There are accepting people out there, but a lot  of  people view trans people in general as an abomination or a pervert.   Being trans is hard enough to deal with on a personal level, but when you have society piling further things onto you, it can be a real   challenge.
13. I  have no hopes or dreams. I wanted to be a video game programmer when I was younger, but taking a programming class squashed the dream into nothingness. I just wasn't any good at programming and didn't enjoy it; I had to do things I wasn't proud of to even pass the class.",suicide

She's manipulative and controls everything in my life.

I feel like throwing up a lot of times from my stress, I can't think straight, I lose sleep, I think not good things.

My dad doesn't try to understand, he only comes in to back her up, and it hurts way more getting yelled at by him, I love him so much and have so much respect for him, but here he is, throwing away all the respect I have for him and show him and making everything worse.

225231,"I want to go to a hospitalHello, I am a sophomore in high school. I feel like I have been mentally broken by the emotional abuse I have suffered from my immediate family and ex boyfriend. 

For as long as I can remember, my mother has hated me, has gone out of her way to make me miserable, and has trained my 13 year old brother to do the same. From calling me fat until I cried in seventh grade and then grounding me for ""not taking a joke"", to responding to my cry for help in eight grade with ""Do it, I wouldn't care. It wouldn't reflect badly on me, you'd just be the weak one."", they have given me extreme body image issues to the point where I don't know what I look like anymore. I think I have Body Dysmorphia because of this- every time I look at my face I see something completely different and find new flaws to be disgusted with. 

However, despite not knowing what I genuinely look like and struggling with eat disorders since seventh grade to present, I was managing with some handleable suicidal tendencies and self esteem issues. I made good friends and among the bad, I have good memories from those times. 

I had been managing for some time, with the help of my boyfriend who was always there to calm me down when I forgot what my face looked like, and who always convinced me to eat whole grain rice when I had only had ice cubes for dinner. He is probably the only reason why I survived the summer of 2014. 

Unfortunately, my self esteem issues got the best of me in a way that I will never forgive myself for. My boyfriend was not the most popular person, in fact he was the ridicule of the school and I was constantly being harassed for being with him. So even though I was deeply in love with him, I felt like I had more of a face when we were apart. So I made up excuses to keep him away, and eventually broke up with him over smoking weed, which is something that both of us partook in. I am so full of remorse and regret for this decision. 

After being broken up for several months, I started understanding my mental issues a bit more, and we made amends and started talking again. One thing led to another and we had sex, and the condom broke. We split the bill of a Plan B pill 50/50, and I was too embarrassed to go into the store. I felt disgusting, like a slut, like some Christian woman would come chastise me for 'killing a child'. I was so mortified that I begged him not to tell anyone. He said he wouldn't. I cried myself to sleep.

I found out that he had told all of his friends when I was at a McDonalds and they came up to me and made fun of me and made references to Plan B pills. I cried. It was the worst experience of my life. 

I went home that night, and once I stopped crying I didn't start again. It was like all of my emotions were overloaded at once, and they shut down. Since that time every 'happy' moment has been faked in an attempt to keep my social circle close. I can't be alone right now. So I do what I have to do to keep people from thinking I'm a downer. The only emotion I feel at this point is sadness. 

My mother saw me crying today. She yelled at me for ""moping around the house"". I want to go to a hospital. I want pills to fix me, to bring back the emotions that went away that night. I want a doctor to diagnose with Dysmorphia so that I can stop telling myself that I'm just a ""special snowflake"" who needs to get over it. More than anything else, I want to know what I really look like. I want to look in a mirror and go ""That's me! I look like this!"" instead of seeing a figure that looks like an alien trying to blend into the human race but not quite getting the details right.

I don‚Äôt know what other girls did when they got home from school. Probably homework and watch tv and go to dance practice. I got naked for strangers on my phone. I learned to model, to sext, to set up a camera, to shave, to lie to my parents, and to smile through it all. They were my boyfriends. I was 11, and they were ‚Äú16‚Äù to most likely 60+. Comforting a man who felt bad for loving to fuck with children and having to tell him it‚Äôll be alright and say it‚Äôs just me to make him not care and use me more, because if I didn‚Äôt have him who would I have?

160616,"Cheated on twice in the past 3 months, can't get off opiates.For the past week I've fantasized about killing myself. My girlfriend of 3 years, who I trusted with every ounce of my being, slept with another guy a few months ago. It wasn't an unconscious fling, her friend tried convincing her not to but she was dead set on cheating. I foolishly took her back after many tears and fights and promises that it would never happen again.

Well it happened again. Ridiculously drunk at her friends party and her ex-boyfriend shows up and kisses her, she gives in and they made out but at least it didn't go farther than that. 

I've been addicted to opiates for more than a year now. I've tried cold turkey and only made it through 3 days before succumbing. The only way I made it that far is blocking out every potentially negative thought but I only felt empty inside. Nothing brings me joy. I hate everyday that I'm at work and my straight A's have plummeted since finding out this.

I've fantasized time and time again about hanging myself or jumping off a cliff. About writing notes to my loved ones apologizing, but it brings me a sick joy to think about how she would feel; how she would go through the rest of her life with horrific guilt knowing that her impulses caused this.

I don't wanna hear ""Bro you'll find someone else!"" I promise you that you don't understand. I won't trust anyone again after this after the things we've experienced. We've had LSD trips where we've literally gazed into each other's souls and cried our eyes out for each other.

312143,"Having an abortion made me realise how meaningless life isI don't feel as though there is any inherent meaning to life.  
And I think all meaning that people try to assign to life comes from a pretty egoistic and material place. Of course, in order to continue living in this material world (who really knows what happens when we die) we do need ego... but I feel as though people let ego blind them into thinking life has more meaning than it actually does.  


I have been having to make a conscious effort to find excuse after excuse to keep trying ever since I fell into a deep, dark hole back in 2014. I was faced with a breakdown of a toxic relationship and the trauma of being forced into terminating a pregnancy because of both circumstances and the guilt of burdening someone who didn't want a child. So I experienced first-hand how meaningless life actually is, and I tried to fill that void with reasons to try so that my experience and trauma wasn't in vain. But ultimately, I couldn't find any real good reason as to why I would have to experience such a trauma if the person I was unfortunate enough to have been involved with didn't have such a selfish disposition.   


I tried to think along the lines of ""I had to make that sacrifice so that my life could be less painful""... which is true. But finding reasons to continue living as someone who has no dependents takes a lot more effort than if I had someone else to live for.

So, for the last 6 years, every day has been an inner monologue of trying to self-soothe, knowing that society's versions of success are completely egoistic and shallow... and ultimately pointless and not worth pursuing. The only reason that I can figure people stick around is because they have dependents. People have children, vulnerable friends, elderly parents, disabled siblings, terminally ill spouses... and generally just people who would be traumatised by their passing.  


I can see how, though, if someone didn't have dependents or anybody who would be severely effected by their death... how it could be very easy to just give up. And people do convince themselves that people don't care or would be better off without them all the time... I myself am not so naive to think that nobody would care and so one of the few things keeping me around is this guilt that leaving would hurt someone.  


I feel rather hollow and terrible and even guiltier when I stick around purely out of guilt... because it feels like I'm blaming others for my internal suffering. So the only thing that soothes this problem of feeling pointless is to paint/create visual art *purely* for the personal enjoyment of it. 

I think the human condition is just a egoistic illusion, and we are wired to want to create to stave off death. We create humans through pregnancy, and every other useless and destructive thing we've encumbered not only the planet but our own lives with... and if we find no reason to create, the drive doesn't leave and thus causes pain. 

So my personal solution for this is to create in a way that is just for me, and for whoever may enjoy it, and hope that staves off the feelings of guilt. I don't know how long it will work for, but I imagine if I can keep my ego in check and practice my art with meditation I could live long enough to die of natural causes and not hurt anybody with my own screaming ego.",suicide

How the fuck is it fair that I get a cushy life and millions of people so much better than myself have it so much rougher? I don't deserve what I do have.

262920,"Hanging on a threadHi I'm not really sure if this is the right place to ask this but here I go.

Very long post ahead. 
Advanced sorry for the shitty formatting.

So I'm currently with a girl (we havent been together for long) and this is the happiest time of my life so far. I'm dead set on making this work. At the beginning I thought that if this fails, I'll never go for a relationship again but it turned into something worse. 

I'd literally choose her over everything. Every outcome I aim for is literally for our relationship and time together(or so i'd like to think) .

I was a bit depressed and a bit suicidal before we got together. Just a bit. No actual acts involved. Though I was thinking very hard to go to a therapist because I felt I was going down that sad inevitable path.

Now I realized that I became fully dependent to her. There were times we came close to a breakup and my thoughts were only zeroing in to suicide. Like there was never another option but that.

She's nice but sometimes she'd like to mess with me (not very serious) but sometimes because of anxiety and trust issues I'd take it seriously but she still won't stop. (for instance I asked who's this guy then she'd answer in a manner that'd make anyone think there's something between the lines).

Sometimes it leads to an endless cycle of fight that would end up with me apologizing like I'm begging for my life. Because I probably am.

A hint of cheating(although unlikely) from her would also give me attacks of ""those"" thoughts. And it' d be enough to keep me wide awake until it gets resolved somehow. 

We havent fought for a time now. And I'm desperately fighting to keep it this way and fortunately there hasnt been anything weird hsppening lately but it's inevitable. I just want to make sure that I'll make it through next time. With her fortunately. 

In my current state, I probably wont last 3 weeks without talking to her. I'd be dead by the end of the 2nd week. I'm wish I am joking but I have enough anger and sadness to push myself from a high place when I'm at a really bad place. (almost seriously did it once. Stood on top of a footbridge for almost two and a half hours. The only thing that kept my feet on the ground was the fact that she hadn't broken up with me yet but was very close to doing so) 


 Everything my life is depends on this relationship right now. I have a lot of hobbies but nothing makes anything work in me when we're fighting. Even the things I love the most turns into nothing when we're fighting. I'm paralyzed. 

So basically, I want to be less dependent. For the sake of both of us. Having someone commit suicide because of you is kind of traumatic(at least for me).

If she ever breaks up with me, i want to last a bit longer than two weeks. She may get convinced that she's not the reason or something. I dont know. Im a mess. I dont even have a reason for writing this right now. I just think I should. 

Having to live without her is something I can never do at this point. 

This is the cringiest thing ive ever written but I have no other way of asking for help.

188803,"""tAlK tO a tHErApIsT!""No, I can't. Here are some reasons why:

1. I don't have the time or the energy to go to one.

2. Even if I did have time, something else would eventually show up and I would need to do that instead, otherwise I can kiss any future career goodbye.

3. I will just be given medications for it. It's not a permanent solution to anything, it's just suppressants that doesn't help with anything and I will explain it in number 4.

4. I'm currently emotionally numb so I almost don't feel anything. The only thing I feel is worthlessness and guilt. I guess this happened because I felt too much pain and sadness that my body automatically blocked out my emotions. This has happened many times before over these past 3 years. My energy (and libido) has gone down drastically, I'm constantly tired and my body is weak even though I eat a good amount of food and sleep for about 6-8 hours a day depending on how tired I am.

5. I'm paranoid that they will laugh or deny that I have problems because I don't know why I am the way that I am. Or the fact that something has been bothering me for a while which I want to discuss. I hate therapists without having any experience with them. Can't help it.

Not a day goes by where I don't think about death and suicide. My mind have had this fog for over 2 years now. More so, it's gotten so bad that I have been viewing myself as a powerless God who is trapped here for eternity. No memories. Nothing. I'm just here to witness humanity and its failures including a failure such as myself.

I have a home, I have money, I am going to college in a nice town with loads of friends. I do group activities, I work with my community and constantly take on fulfilling projects. I eat good food, drink pleanty of water, exercise daily. Life can't get better.

That's why I want to kill myself. 

I feel nothing. Happiness as a concept is unimaginable. My family is disgusted with me. My father and I haven't spoken in months (*I* cut *him* out my life) and my mother finds the idea of me repulsive. I have spent so much of my life just trying to survive that now I do not know how to feel joy. My body is failing me. My memory is getting worse and worse every day, and I am in pain. There is nothing beyond this for me. This is as good as it all gets. There is no point to being alive - no joy, no love. It's just not in the cards for me. 

I have dysphoria. I am transgender. If I medically transition my family will disown me - which is strange. I don't really think HRT will make me happy, no one thing could do that, but I when I find myself in trans-spaces I find that looking at other trans people who have already transitioned makes me feel hopeless. I want what they have so *so* badly, but I know that won't happen for me. Not until I live independently. I've thought about checking myself into a hospital, however, I was abused when I was 14 in one. Now that I have transitioned I am terrified more than ever of such an event repeating. Transgender people are not treated well by professionals very often, I work with the community enough to know that.

I don't know what to do with myself. I love being alive, but I can't stand it. Life is such a precious, *good* thing - why can't I enjoy it? Why don't I get to be happy and loved? 

Everything in my life seems perfect, everything is set to make me happy - it's an insult to all the people I saw given nothing. I've seen poverty, disease, death, abuse - I could do nothing to help them, and yet I survived so why can't I just be happy? These people drowned with *nothing* to keep them afloat and yet here I am unable to find joy right under my nose. What is wrong with me?

The most terrifying thought of all is this - what if everyone is like me? What if every one is suicidal and miserable, and just faking it to get by? If that's the case, then I should die right now. If nothing can make this better, and happiness is just a lie by the media or society or whoever, what then?",suicide

I'm a 27 year old with bipolar I with mixed episodes. Some of the meds I take destroy me and make it so I can't get through the day. This isn't a cry for help; It's just facts being stated. I feel I need to get them out. I'll be transferring all my money in to my family's accounts. I'm playing with my dog a lot so she can still get at least a little out of me before I go. I've cleaned my house, removed everything embarrassing from my belongings. I've sorted out all the books I'd like them to read. After some more cleaning and saying good bye to people without letting on that I'll be dead in three days.
    
I've written up a list of how I want my body destroyed. I don't know if anyone cares other than my dog. I'll be leaving a hastily written note before I go out.
    
I don't see the value in my life anymore. It's mostly the bipolar but there are straight facts that make my life worth living. I don't care for anyone but my family reading my note.    
I'm betting you guys are used to this nonsense, but I feel at least a little of my story should be told.    
I've been diagnosed with Bipolar I and there is no medication that can cure or at least treat me. I feel like a robot, putting things of mine out of the way before I'm found. BP1 entails manic-depressive label most people do label us with. I have my mixed episodes of being depressed, delusional, happy, ecstatic, a retching sensation and no one understands. People I talk to don't get it. Even people I've talked to on reddit about this stuff don't seem to get my demons.    
It feels like a black core at the center of my torso. Nothing seems worth it. I don't date. I don't have anything I actually enjoy doing these days, on the computer or otherwise. I'm a useless waste of space with a menial job and no hopes or dreams of the future.    
What the fuck is the point?
    
Three days. Heroin overdose. Please don't judge me, or even understand what I'm going through. I just needed to tell SOMEONE since I've not a single friend.

Guess im pretty ugly

If i could leave i really would

Guess i'll need to be sad
Cause i can never be mad
i always used to cry
My eyes have now gone dry
They've cut my wings and now i cannot fly

They tell me go die in a ditch

They'll see the fireworks
I'll be home i'll rehearse
How to say my last goodbyes and i'll glitch.

I‚Äôve also been just sleeping and avoiding my schoolwork. I only do it because I want my parents to leave me alone. I have no friends, I‚Äôm a toxic manipulator by apologizing constantly to the people I talk to. I put myself down and drive them away and I radiate such negative energy. I also try my best to acknowledge it, I want someone to scream at me the things I‚Äôve told myself. I want them to make me realize what a disgusting piece of shit I am. But also when I acknowledge it I do nothing to change it. I keep telling myself it‚Äôs because I secretly like being absolute garbage. I don‚Äôt have the guts to kill myself in the end but it‚Äôs so fucking hard living. I feel like every time I reach even an inch closer to happiness I‚Äôm flung 20 feet deeper. I‚Äôd blame my resilience for that. I just feel like I‚Äôm on self-destruct mode, like something was set off in my brain and it‚Äôs caving in on itself slowly. I‚Äôm finally getting my karma, and I‚Äôm waiting for everyone and everything to leave me. I don‚Äôt understand how people think I deserve love when all I dish out back is remarks that refute their attempts. I can‚Äôt fathom someone actually loving something like me, I really can‚Äôt.
I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, and I won‚Äôt say I‚Äôve hit rock bottom, because I said that last time I felt bad and look where I‚Äôm at now! I‚Äôm conflicted and I want to know what my actions will do, who else I‚Äôll hurt and everything such. I keep crying over these things and it‚Äôs such a painful emotion clutter, like left and right and back and forth.

I‚Äôm so fucking torn I feel like I‚Äôm stuck forever. Everything‚Äôs been hurting and I can‚Äôt even change because of my goddamn resilience. JUST KILL ME!!",suicide
145733,"I want to die.I wish I could just freeze time and let me work everything out. 

My fianc√© of 1 year left me, out of the blue. I was still in the honeymoon stage, and I truly believe she is my soulmate. I already suffer from clinical depression, so this was just the cherry on top.

She still calls me on the phone, texts me and acts like we're best friends. She said she just needs time to figure out what she wants. I'm pretty sure she isn't messing around with anybody though (she isn't that type.) I know talking to her is bad for me, but I don't know if I could take losing her.

Everything I do reminds me of her. I was on 4chan... 4CHAN. And a thread made me start crying because it reminded me of her. I can't... Um.. Touch myself.. Without thinking of her and I start crying. Even writing this now is painful.

Honestly, I wanted a future with her. A home. Children. I was so emotionally invested in her. I gave her my entire heart, and I love every thing about her. I've always done everything I could to make her happy. And now I'm broken.

Some cute girl was flirting with me, but all I could think was ""she's not HER. All I want is HER.""

I'll never be able to love someone else. She was absolutely perfect. I'll forever be comparing other girls to her.

I've been severely depressed for so long, and she was the only reason I got up in the morning. I don't know how I'm going to get on without her. I'm 18 (and female) and after I tried to kill myself several months ago, I dropped out of high school. I could never go back. 

I know I should get my GED, but I can't afford it. Also, it's hard enough for me to get out of bed each morning, and sometimes I don't even do that. My father keeps screaming at me, calling me a stupid worthless daughter. He tells me ""just because I'm ""sad"" doesn't mean I shouldn't get off my lazy ass and get a job and finish school."" 

I have no friends, no family who cares about what happens to me. I spend all day every day alone, in my room. Sometimes I sleep all day, or I watch movies, or I go on Reddit. But I don't want to live anymore. Everything hurts too much.

I can't even remember when something good happened to me, aside from meeting my now ex-girlfriend. Nothing good ever happens to me. I'm not pretty, or motivated, or athletic, or smart. I'm just a waste of oxygen.

I can't even afford to get medication or any kind of help. Even the free programs I've looked into want me to pay ridiculous costs to be admitted. I have $0 to my name, so that's not going to happen. I don't know what to do. I want to die so bad it hurts. I'm curled up in a ball and it's so hard to breathe. I just needed to tell somebody.

205509,"I can't take it anymoreThis is my first time typing something here and this might be long. I'm sorry if so.

I've been depressed for the past few years now. I'm 19 years old and right now I just feel like utter shit, like I'm hopeless and I cannot do one thing right that will make my parent(mother) be happy of me. I would say this started when I was in middle school, I got a bad grade in some class, I explained to my dad(who was on drugs on that time). He gets mad, grabs one of the medium-sized Jamaican heads we had in our home and he hits me with it. The next day I go to my school therapist to discuss what happened. Now before I had no idea what CPS was, but according to her what my father did was enough to make the call.

So she calls, later on when I get home my mom calls me into her room. And instead of understanding my choice she blatantly bashed me, telling me that I was the one in the wrong, not my father. I was ignored and treated like shit for months and I never once, even now, received something that made me feel my choice was okay from them.

Now into high school. At a young age my mom put me into track and field, a sport that I had a lot of talent in, even making it into the JO(Junior Olympics). However due to issues w/ money, my mom, bro, and I had to move to another city. Long story short I did pretty shitty in track, I still have no idea why. While I was good in track and received many calls about colleges wanting me in their school, it just wasn't...me. I was only doing it for my mother because I know how happy it made her. But one night after a track meet she yelled and screamed about how I was ""embarrassing"" her - as if she was the one running her ass off and trying to impress her daughter. So that was it. I told her I quit and I just didn't nothing. 

My grades dropped sorely and I even ran to my HS therapist to tell her I wanted to kill myself. She calls my mom, who glares at me as if again, I was the one in the wrong, then swiftly leaves. I spend time in a mental institute, get out a few days later only for my mom to immediately tell me how disappointed she is of me. 

During the span on my senior year and now, I have thought of suicide many many times, but only actually did an action twice. My last one was last May and I OD'd. I was in the mental hospital for a  week and only received visits from my father and my aunt(who I haven't spoken to for even seen prior for years). But guess who wasn't there for me? Right. My mother.

Just last week I told my mother I wanted to drop out of college because I literally had to motivate myself to go. Example, I would lie to her saying the class got canceled when it actually wasn't. I was tired of trying to make her and others proud of me. Instead I wanted to do something that would make MYSELF happy. Oddly enough, before she said I could do anything I wanted to do. And now that I actually decide it's just a giant shitstorm. She blackmails me about taking away my only connection to online friends(my irl friends abandoned me the moment I moved despite me sending texts to them). It was just around 15 minutes ago she called me into her room asking me what I did. I tell her since I'm depressed I stayed in bed and cried. However I did call a company for their app and prepared to send it to them tomorrow.

But no, she yells, tells me I won't get that job. Long story short, she wants to control my life and I won't let her. I've been under her roof since I was born, and don't get my wrong I would LOVE to move out. However I do not currently have a job so I cannot support myself. I cannot even explain how frustrated I am. I fear that if she takes away my laptop, not only will I lose contact with my only friends but I won't be able to write anymore(something that I've done for nine years). I've definitely thought about suicide again, however my friends and my father makes me push away that. But I admit the thought of never having to see my mother again or listen to her put me down makes me feel so good.

At this point I feel nothing for her. She could literally have a heart attack and I won't care. Why should I? She's never been there for me. She's never causes me any sort of happiness, in fact she's a big reason why I've wanted to kill myself. According to her I'm always in the wrong, me me me. And I'm so tired. I'm mentally exhausted and I just want to go away forever to a place where I don't have to worry about things any longer. I don't even know what a mother's love feels like and I really want to. I want her out of my life and I want it asap. 

Please help me, anyone. I don't know what else I have to do. ",suicide
104310,"My years of mistakes are too much for me to recover from. I think I need someone to talk to?I don't know what to say without typing for days on end. I guess I'll just type.

I have five children. And a loving husband. I am a college graduate, I have a job. I feel so hopeless and completely underwater that there's no real way out from here, even though those first few things sound great. 

I love my husband, and my children with all of my heart. I've had trouble with depression off and on for awhile, but even when I'm feeling 'ok,' I don't think it's for very long that I can go without causing trouble or making someone upset. I have relied on my poor husband for so long (7 years) to be my support while also treating him like shit. He's tired of it. I don't blame him. I imagine leaving for good, my only regret being that I couldn't make people happy before I leave. I used to be an amazing mother, playdates, fun activities, care and attention, loving patience. Now I'm just cold and distant, sometimes seeing my beautiful daughter's face or watching my toddler learn new skills makes me incredibly happy but that happiness is beaten down with doubt and worry. I think about how wonderful my children are, and then a stab of guilt at having yelled at them the night before, or forgetting the invites for my son‚Äôs birthday, or not having enough time or attention to devote to each child comes to mind. I think‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt deserve this. I‚Äôve had so many children that I cannot possibly and in any sane way keep up with them all and give them the love and support that they need. I feel so frustratingly and immensely guilty at having done this, made this bed for myself and this life for my family‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve created a life where there‚Äôs so much going on that no one has time for everything they need. 
Then there‚Äôs my husband. I‚Äôve treated him very well, and in many ways have been a really great wife. I outshadow those nice things, and I mean really, really outshadow them, by always worrying that he‚Äôs going to leave and accusing him of cheating. I did this in a different way in the beginning of our relationship. Small dismissible lies from him turned into a huge deal for me and fueled my thoughts of him lying even more.  Then, I looked on his computer without his permission and found exactly what I was looking for ‚Äì dating sites and messages to women dating back months, and often very graphic. I deserved this. He told me in fights that I deserved that, and then recounted that idea to tell me he didn‚Äôt mean it. I think I hurt more because I know deep down, I deserve much worse. 
I‚Äôve let down everyone in my life that matters. I have had second, third, fourth, fifth chances and each and every time I allow my guilt and worry ruin it. I genuinely don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm a good enough person to be here. Thinking that makes me feel incredibly worse when I realize I have created a life in which a lot of people depend on me being someone worthy of being here. That is so, so selfish but I don‚Äôt know what to do. My husband often tells me that I just need to fix myself somehow, seek help, work on myself, talk to someone, correct my behavior. I have sought help, and a lot of it. Not as much as I should, I guess since I am still here typing this right now. 
My husband really believes I want this, he believes I care about nothing else but being sad. He told me I don‚Äôt care about my children, about him, about anything, just my sad, selfish, crazy, asshole self. He yelled at me that if I leave, whether moving out or leaving the world for good, that I am continuing to ruin everyone‚Äôs life by leaving him ‚Äòholding the bag‚Äô from all of my mistakes. He said there‚Äôs nothing in the world I can do to make him feel better about me ‚Äòcompletely ruining‚Äô his life. I see it in his eyes, he‚Äôs frustrated. He deserved someone that could be caring and attentive and instead he got me. I feel really bad that anyone had to know me, that I ruined so many people‚Äôs lives just by being here. 
He never seems to listen when I tell him that this isn‚Äôt what I want. I don‚Äôt think I will ever be able to get through to him, the fact that I don‚Äôt want this, I just want everyone to be happy and in my own circle of kindness, self doubt, loss of self worth and yelling at him for stupid things like spending time with a female friend, I kill that hope. I will start arguments about really stupid things, like a worry that he‚Äôs cheating or that I‚Äôve been a terrible mom. The thing is, I know these things aren‚Äôt true. I don‚Äôt actually believe he‚Äôs cheating, or any of the stupid things I yell at him. The truth is, I don‚Äôt feel like I can handle my life. I can‚Äôt keep working full time, trying to keep up with the kids, trying to be a good wife, that I let the slightest infrequent thought ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs probably worth more to him because he hasn‚Äôt seen her yell at the kids,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already made so many mistakes that no good thing I do will right them,‚Äù turn into a self doubt that I turn on my husband. He might never know that I don‚Äôt really want to split up, I don‚Äôt hate him, I don‚Äôt hate my family. I really hate myself. If I give it enough thought, I realize that I often push people away because if they hate me, it will be easier to leave for good knowing that some part of them knew I wasn‚Äôt worth it just like I do. 
I don‚Äôt know what I need here, I feel really overwhelmed. Real people have real issues and I‚Äôm sitting here feeling sorry for myself. I am a selfish person, and I don‚Äôt know what I can possibly do to make things better for my family. 
My husband just yelled at me that either I need to leave or he‚Äôs going to leave but when I went to leave he told me again about how I‚Äôm ruining his life by leaving him holding the bag, and about how I should have tried harder. But he also tells me I‚Äôm a shitty person if I stay, and that all that needs to happen is for me to be the sort of person that I should be, but that is impossible and a huge mountain to climb. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Why not?    
Because you're too scared.    
Oh. So I can't die?    
You can die. Just not right now.    
Oh.. so what am I supposed to do?    
How should I know? Live your life I guess...    
Live my life? How can I possibly do that?    
What do you mean?    
I mean, I can't seem to live my life. I'm constantly anxious and depressed.    
Oh.    
Oh indeed.    
So what do you want me to do about it?    
Give me death.    
I can't. As I said, you're too scared.    
So... do I just suffer?    
No, you could keep trying.    
I feel that's all I seem to be doing. It's exhausting.    
So what's worse? Trying and feeling exhausted, or being depressed and wishing you were dead?    
I don't know. It feels liberating to give up and wish for death...    
But that's not what you want is it?    
No.    
You'd prefer to try than give up really, right?    
Yeah.. but it's still exhausting.    
Then don't try too hard. Try a little bit at a time. You'll feel less exhausted, and less depressed surely?    
I suppose. Wouldn't that take longer?    
Longer than what?    
Longer than I'd like?    
Maybe, but I'm sure you'd also like to get where you want to be later than not at all.    
I suppose. Still makes me feel like a failure.    
Why?    
It feels like a race that I'm losing.    
Who are you racing against?    
Other people I guess.    
Who cares about other people?    
I do!    
Do you?    
Yes!    
Do you really?    
Yes... I think.    
Why does it matter to your life how fast they do something?    
I mean, it doesn't really...    
They're just doing their thing, and you should be doing yours. There is no race.    
Sure feels like it...    
That's probably because you see your old school friends on Facebook celebrating achievements and having fun.   
I do do that.    
No one puts on the mundane parts of their life. Only the best bits. You only see a glorified slice of their life.    
Really?    
Really. They're probably no different to you to be honest. We're all pretty much in the same boat.    
Oh. That helps to know actually.    
Just do you at your own pace and you'll be fine. You'll feel shitty sometimes, that's just part of the process.    
Is it?    
Yes. Do you always feel like you want to die every hour of every day? Or does it come and go like a wave?     
Comes and goes.    
These feelings aren't a true reflection of you. You're not a failure. You're just feeling down.    
Why though? Why can't i feel good?    
What, all the time?    
No, not ALL the time.    
What then, most of the time? Even that's a stretch.    
It is?    
Yup. Emotions are messy and fleeting. They don't sum up your life. They don't define you.    
So what do I do when I'm feeling like this?    
Just accept it. It feels bad, sure, but know that it'll pass. The time to achieve small goals is when I mood climbs again.    
Really?    
Yes. It's much harder in a bad state of mind. Take advantage of the good moods. Use them to improve yourself. You'll find you can do a lot if you put your mind to it.   
I guess I can try to do that.    
Even saying you're going to try is a small achievement and a great start. Keep climbing to the life you want, and don't give up when you feel down. It is temporary.    
What about setbacks?    
Setbacks?    
Yeah, like something big? Like losing your job, or someone close has died. That seems more that a simple mood swing.    
It's devastating yes, but those feelings pass too. If you can process what happened and learn to accept it, you'll find yourself climbing once more. It just takes longer than average. So, do you still want that death?    
Not as much.    
An improvement! Thats another small achievement. Keep noticing those and you'll be fine.

344064,"Life tips from an old ballsack English is not my first language yada yada...

\- Be realistic. That goes for all aspects of your life (relationships, jobs, college, beauty ...): Most people don't have the money / time / emotional conditions to buy a mansion, have an Olympic-size swimming pool, have sex worthy of a porn movie every day, do plastic surgery, travel every year ... What I mean is, keep dreaming, but learn to appreciate simpler and more realistic things. Nowadays teenagers receive encouragement from all sides about how successful, wealthy, beautiful and hot all people are, and how you should be so as not to be a complete failure. Just don't believe the hype.

\- Nobody cares about your popularity in high school. With rare exceptions, you probably won't be in touch with almost anyone you went to school with, so don't be too stressed by their opinion.

\- No, life is not boring. Life seems boring to you because you feel so much more than adults (thanks, hormones), and it is for that same reason that you may think that people don't love you. But take the opportunity to cry a lot when you end a relationship, and fall in love like you're in a movie, and have fun like you're going to be a teenager forever.

\- Learn to put yourself more in the shoes of others (especially your parents). And yes, I am aware that some of you have parents who are complete imbeciles, but most of you do not. I know that carrying out tasks at home is a pain, and that following orders that you consider useless is also a pain, but believe me, you would also be without much patience if you worked all day, were responsible for creating someone else, made food, wash clothes, and have to beg someone to wash a dish or take out the trash.

\- You will probably never have as much free time as you do now, so invest at least a little of that time to learn things that will be useful in the future: taxes, work, extracurricular activities, learning a new language ... It's more worth going fewer parties now and have a better job in the future (to have money to spend on parties lol)

\- Eventually you are going to have a relationship, and have sex, so relax.

36642,"I really just don't know anymore manOK, so I really got to get this out, because I just DON'T know anymore. I've been at odds with my mother for YEARS, a bit of backstory here to set the mood on this... So I'm prone to have a bit of a nasty and quick temper sometimes and an oddball mindset; I've grown up with the notion that if you can't treat others with respect, you don't deserve to have mine (treat others how you want to be treated, basically), I do believe that respect is something you have to earn from others through effort and hard work... You can't just force someone to give it to you (manners are something entirely different, now everyone should have those!) I'm a 20-year-old, soon to be 21 that still lives with my mother because I'm unable to drive due to a deathly fear of driving (I've literally ripped the steering wheel out of her hands before to try pushing our car away from someone who was driving carelessly and got too close to our car, MULTIPLE times before) I suffer from severe depression, and what my therapist believes is PTSD (from a poor family environment/abusive parent) since I was little. I was involved in a major accident when I was younger that caused severe brain damage, basically baby-shaken syndrome, and over the years I've grown from just having really bad headaches and migraines as well as being slightly forgetful, to having mild seizures as of now, they're sporadic and unpredictable in nature of when they'll happen, and I don't usually get aura's when mine occur (an aura is like a forewarning that they're coming on) and EXTREMELY forgetful, like you tell me something and not even three minutes later I'll forget and have to ask you what to do again. I am rather slow minded as well due to this although by no means am I stupid, had I not dropped out of school due to bullying and harassment I'd probably have been a straight A student all the way through college, if that's what life had planned for me, although it, unfortunately, did not...

So basically... I've been caged and chained down to my mother's house, regardless of how badly I wish I could leave and be free to live my own life the way I want to. So here's the thing though... According to my mom (she's an idiot, might I add), I'm not ""allowed"" to be depressed, I've never known what it is and ""shouldn't use that word so lightly"". I'm also apparently, according to her, ""riding her tailcoat and crying about everything"", ""a lazy and stupid bitch that's never worked a day in my life"" and ""Is only nice when I want something and then an asshole after I get it"". Which might I add, I HATE asking for things, if I can't get it myself by some means, I usually won't ask for it... I'm that kid that's always hated Christmas and birthdays because I don't like getting things from people, my entire family (mom, sister, father) have always been money hungry assholes who will do ANYTHING for money, even go as far as to wish death on their own parents to get inheritance faster, so... I never wanted to be like them, I HATE that garbage mindset they all have. I grew up basically alone and raised myself, for the most part, my mother was never home (the only working member in the household up until their divorce) and my father was mentally and emotionally abusive, as was my sister who was always on his side for everything, whether that was just out of fear he'd do the same things to her or just because she's an asshole herself, I honestly couldn't tell you. So I grew up with my own special little mindset based on when I observed from others and learned I didn't like, and other people didn't like (none of that entitled BS slides with me).

So onto the true matter here... and forgive this post for being so long, I honestly don't even know if this is where it belongs but by this point I honestly have to ask someone else about this because I'm just so confused and done with everything in this life by now... But with the stage set here, let's get onto the main issue and reason for posting. So as said before, my mom's points are as follows;

‚ó¶¬†I'm lazy and a slob.
‚ó¶¬†I'm an asshole
‚ó¶¬†I'm stupid/retarded/etc.
‚ó¶¬†I CANNOT be depressed or have PTSD.
‚ó¶¬†I was never abused by any means.
‚ó¶¬†I'm a liar.
‚ó¶¬†Everything I think or say doesn't matter.
‚ó¶¬†Everything wrong with me is ""Just an excuse"" to be lazy.
‚ó¶¬†There's nothing wrong with me.

So our house is¬†ALWAYS¬†a mess, it's disgusting and honestly, so full of dirt and dust that it's probably making my health issues worse. It's¬†ALWAYS¬†been this way since the divorce, my mother will not clean or do¬†ANYTHINGaround the house. We'll have dirty dishes in the sink collecting mold for up to a month and a half before she'll clean them, she throws her newspapers wherever the hell she feels like it and leaves it there until it becomes an inconvenience to her, in which she will order ME to pick it all up (she doesn't even ask, it's a demand) and she can't even take the trash bag out of the garbage when it gets full, she just yells at me to do it for her or she piles it up until it's overflowing out onto the floor and¬†THEN¬†she yells at¬†ME¬†for not taking it out sooner (It never gets full when I'm the only one home, and on the rare occasion it does, I will take it out on my own.) I regularly these days, take the time and effort to vacuum and clean the rooms on my own without being asked to, because honestly, it got so bad back in December when she went on a month long trip out of country that I couldn't breathe in my own home¬†(and believe me, it felt like I was in heaven once it was all clean! I could finally breathe again and the house just felt so fresh and light, there was NO heavy air and no negativity in the house). So, while extremely ill at the time, I set to work for three full weeks cleaning the entire house top to bottom because I was sick and tired of it being so disgusting and realizing that would be my only chance to enjoy a clean house for once. She came home and¬†didn't even tell me ""Thank you"" for what I did*, she just started making a mess again immediately even though I asked her to keep it clean (for my own sake, and that of our animals) and started bitching about how my old baby sitter (an ex-family friend) had come over and helped me clean when I had gotten too sick to do it alone (my seizures were acting up really badly at the time due to stress and anxiety from being alone for so long). I had set up a designated area for newspaper and letters to go respectively, so the house wouldn't end up cluttered in trash again. I've been going to my therapist for almost a full year now, and while it helps slightly to visit with her, she's a wonderful woman btw, I don't get to see her often enough for therapy to really help me much. I see her maybe once a month these days and by the time I get to see her the next time I'm RIGHT back where I started before the last time, usually stressing out badly and crying bullets in a debate on whether to just kill myself and be done with this bullshit or if it's my fault in the end.

I will admit, I do have a terrible memory and I do often put cheese wrappers on the counter and forget them (my older dog needs medication every day so I'm more focused on getting her to eat the pills she needs) so I do forget about them quite often, but I will pick them up if I see them or remember! I pick up my own garbage if it's nearby me and I can see it (the gods know if my head wasn't attached I'd never find it again once I set it down) and I often am left picking up her garbage as well, since she'll just accuse me of it being mine anyway and make me do so regardless; she often calls me stupid, dumbass or other things simply because I'm forgetful and slow minded, which I honestly cannot help... I really wish I could be better and more efficient but that just isn't possible, nor will it ever be. If there's a problem around the house I'll try to fix it myself or I'll ask for help from a neighbor who knows more than I do¬†(which pisses my mother off, let me tell you).¬†Apparently I'm a liar because I often get into squabbles with her (she loves to piss me off and knows just what buttons to push, as I am extremely short tempered and irritable these days due to all her bullshit over the years) and these days I tend to call her out on her bullshit and attempt to talk about it and see if I can do anything to make things better, because I'm at wits end and sick of this crap already... it's been about eight years of this garbage from her alone,¬†not to mention the six or seven years of my dad's mental and emotional abuse BEFORE that.¬†So, i wanted to inquire as well, about this ""abuse"" because my mother says it¬†never happened*, even though she was never home to see it for herself (and I will admit once when I was younger a teacher had actually called her about me, without me knowing at the time, about me wanting to commit suicide and being suicidal when I was about eight or nine years old ((of course, like the proud and withdrawn little shit I was, I denied it because at that point... I gave up on asking for help from adults. I had asked and begged and pleaded for so long before that time that I realized nobody cared about me and I was better just dealing with it alone (((HUGE mistake on my part, but we won't go into that)))). So onto that matter now... my father was abusive, by all means, I mean... He used to force me to watch Tv with him, which was usually crime shows or the news (break-ins/murder/rape/kidnapping/sexual assult/etc.) hence my horrible anxiety about being alone with or without other people around, because if I got up and walked away from whatever he was watching, or if I admitted I didn't like it, he would get up and chase me into my room, get*¬†IN MY FACE¬†and¬†SCREAM¬†at me and threaten to beat the shit out of me over it; he used to pick me up when I was very young and throw me over his shoulder and raise his hand like he was going to beat my ass¬†JUST¬†to make me cry because it made him laugh when I'd squirm and scream and cry, even if I wasn't doing anything wrong to deserve it, he'd take my dogs/cats/whatever I had, drive and throw them out in the middle of the desert to die (this was a constant for most of our dogs) and the one dog I had, that I really loved (she was my heart and soul during my early childhood, and my first self-owned/picked dog that was just mine and not my families) when she got sick with parvo, he demanded my mother not take her to the vet to be put down, because ""it was a waste of money"" and to just let him just bash her skull in with a sludge hammer (believe me, that wouldn't have been a fast nor painless death for her... as I'm sure he would have been slow and cruel about it had he been allowed to do that.)¬†.Which let me bring up a quick note here, my mother always knew that he was a drunkard asshole, because he's hated me since I got into that car accident when I was young. He had told her to ""not waste money on me"" and to take me off life support and let me die (which I wasn't on life support btw, I was surviving on my own). Even after that, when I came out of my coma and finally was cleared to come home, she HERSELF told me... he said ""You're too fucked up to play with"" and LAUGHED at me when I ran to her CRYING after what he said. So why would she deny he could have possibly been abusive?

So anyway... to finish this off finally (I'm sorry if I forgot anything major here) apparently, according to my mother, all my seizures, my extreme fear of driving (it's literally crippling, I really wish I could just live my life normally like everyone else) and my depression, anxiety and social detachment are ALL JUST EXCUSES to be lazy and stay with her... Believe me, if I could live normally I'd be MILES away from her, I'd love nothing more than to have my own home, my own yard... grass, flowers, a place for me and my animals to just be ourselves, a clean home with no heavy air due to negativity and anger filling it, to paint my walls whatever color I wanted and decorate my home how i see fit to do so... I'd LOVE to have a job, I'm a perfectionist by nature (as is my mother, what the hell ever happened to that side of her, I'll never know) and most of my family have that trait, I feel so worthless and like fucking garbage and a waste of space and life just rotting away due to health issues that I've mainly caused myself, due to years of addiction to soda (that was caused by a medication i was forced to take that wasn't meant for me ((I didn't have what it was for, my doctor was just a dumbass), and not taking proper care of myself because of the depression and feeling like nobody would ever love or care about me... I'd want nothing more than to feel successful and be happy, I hate sitting here doing nothing, never able to do anything or go anywhere... But she pushes my buttons far too often and I show her such a bad side of me because of how she treats me, you could literally ask any of my friends (the very few I have) or strangers that I've helped in the past... I'm a really nice person, I love and care about everyone... even the people who've hurt me badly and screwed me over in the past, I still care about those people and hope the best for them with their lives. I'm that kind of person, yes I do have a bit of a fucked up sense of humor and I can be irritable but generally... I'm really kindhearted, aside from all my temper issues and social problems I'm really nice. Hell, I haven't even been able to think about dying, simply over the fact that if I did... where would my cats and dogs end up? They'd be on the streets malnourished around these parts, ending up as roadkill or taco meat and that thought hurts me far more than anything I deal with in because of mom or other people does. That would just be so selfish of me and I can't do that to them, they need me so...

As Sokrates (or Socrates, however you prefer to spell it) would have said, if you remain bitter and hateful towards those who have hurt you in the past, are you not JUST as likely to hurt others in the same way as they hurt you?... I don't want to hurt anyone, or hate anyone, grudges are worthless and a waste of time, the world will never get any better with people who hold onto things like that... But I want to know, am I the asshole for reacting badly to my mother's treatment of me? I understand she works, she's tired... she probably puts up with a lot of shit, but she always takes it out on me and I'm just so tired of it... 

I'm getting an MRI done today, to see how bad the damage is now, if the seizures will get worse and if I have any tumors or anything, I'll update eventually on that for anyone that cares about it, but I just want to know, really...

Am I an asshole here in this situation? Are those really just excuses... I used to think I knew the answers to these questions but I just don't know anymore... I've been holding onto this for years but honestly, I'm starting to realize bottling up my emotions, problems and fears and keeping them there until I eventually kick the bucket isn't the way to go.

I'm not actively suicidal, it's more of a passive ""I want to"" but I'll never act on it, or at least not in the foreseeable future type of thing. I really just want to know what others think because I have no idea anymore...",suicide

I'm certainly no doctor, but my understanding of going under a general anaesthetic more likened to a temporary coma than sleeping, or to put it more bluntly, a ""temporary death"". I already struggle with depression, and now that I realize how tranquil such a ""death"" is, I'm really concerned that this experience will make me more likely to attempt self-harm as I'm less afraid of death as a result.

I am 20 years old and have had constant thoughts of suicide for about five years now. During this time I have educated myself about this topic and actually don't have any rational problems with killing myself. The problem is that I am quite afraid of the pain I have to endure before it is finally over and in addition to that I think I would ruin the life of my parents.

On the other hand however is it very difficult for me to talk to someone about my problems. In fact during all those years I never really talked with anyone about my problems.
To make everything even more complicated I also don't really wanna change. This may sounds stupid but I have been yearn for death for a very long time now. I don't really now anything else. This is who I am for a very long time now and changing myself would mean to abandon myself.

Yeah well that's pretty much it.

I will probably get a lot of hate from here anyway.

I was just outed as a pedophile. Now to be clear I have NEVER touched a child in a sexual manner I even go to therapy every week. I was just born with sexual attraction to prepubescent and I hate it. I don't want this, if I could change it trust me I would.

Anyway, awhile ago I accidentally made a post on this account instead of my alt account I had made for the post. The post was a confession letter, even my therapist thought it would be a good idea to write it all down, well I was drunk and didn't switch to my alt account. After finally realizing I had posted it on the wrong account I deleted it. however someone had a screen shot, and gave this screen shot to someone that is a tad vindictive bc I made fun of her in modmail on another sub. She posted it, now its climbing on /r/drama 

If this was a completely anon account it wouldn't be a big deal, but there are people in my real life that know I am Toucan, they know this account. They will see it and most if not all will not be friendly about it, one of them I even work with, will I even still have a job soon?

What will happen when my family finds out?

The internet was the one place I could create a new persona for myself and get away from the shit hand that the world dealt me IRL, I've spent years being this person and now that's been taken from me.

So that's really the deal now, my life is going to burn down around me so why stick around to watch it right? People like me are fucked up in the head and probably shouldn't exist in the first place right? Surely it's only a matter of time before I hurt someone.

So yeah, here goes my short biography.
I've never been liked in general by other kids‚Ñ¢, I've spend my childhood alone, with parents yelling at each other at home and they was divorced when I was 10, with over sensitive, mellow mother and callous father. Ofc I was bullied, I've spent few nights crying, I've been having some psychological problems kid of shit and started going to therapists(they're ll was meh) when I invited other kids at my birthday party having some hope that someone will come only 3 of them out of 15 arrived, and gave me some cheap, shitty presents, and I stopped caring about social shit when I hit 12.
I was always having problems to relate to others, to understand what they feel. I knew why the're feeling that, but I was cold as stone from the beginning. So, when I hit 12 I started to stop caring about my grades, I don't studied, tbh I never liked to study, to listen that borning shit and doing equaly borning notes. Anyway I still managed to get to higher classes on the lowest grades possible. Teachers tried to motivate me, wasn't working. Some of them said that I was inteligent and have great imagination‚Ñ¢, but I was not interested in it. I wasn't interested at anything.
When I hit 14 hatred started consuming me, and as I was getting older it was getting stronger, then bloodlust joined, mostly taking over me.
I've spent 4 next years pretending to be caring and kind person, and it worked for everyone but my mother who was my personal ,,punching bag"".(I wasn't reffering to physical violence, but the psychological one, the shitton of it, making my poor mother crying at nights and feeding on it with zero guilt)

I don't care about people, I don't care about my social image when NOBODY teached me how to live in society, I can't make connections with people, but I will do anything to turn your life into hell and get what I want.
And here I am now, an asocial and antisocial fuck with no perspectives on future, good day/nigh and whatevyr‚Ñ¢.

Literally from the moment I was born, I had a breathing issue that had to be dealt with. Less than a year later, I got a very bad case of the flu and had to get hospitalized. A few years ago, I slipped on something (still no idea what the fuck it was), hit my head, and could've bled out if the doctor hadn't hurried the fuck up.

I'm also being driven to suicide by bullshit that's not my fault. I'm bisexual, so of course both of my parents seem to be biphobic. I've been to four different schools, two of which have consisted of mostly bullies and homophobes. At one of my schools, even the teachers hated me even though I was a well behaved student. It also doesn't help that I'm autistic, so going through all of this shit while only being able to keep one friend is tough.

On the topic of my one friend, for literally no reason, I've just lost all interest in talking to him. I like him and he's really nice, I just lost interest for no reason. Then that makes me feel lonely, and I feel horrible for not wanting to talk to him, which makes me even more depressed and even closer to suicide.

There are only two things that have stopped me from suicide. One is my cat, one of the few beings on this planet who actually fucking cares about me. The other is just a lack of planning. I don't know how I would even do it.

If the universe is out to kill me, can it please hurry? I want to fall asleep tonight and never wake up. That would literally be the best thing to ever happen to me. If I died tonight, my one friend and my cat would be upset. Everyone else would get over it within 2 weeks I feel like.",suicide

My story is pretty pathetic, and is mostly just me whining while other people have it so much worse. But for those of you who think it‚Äôll help, I‚Äôll do my best to explain. Sorry, it may be a bit long. 

When I was 10 years old and going into 5th grade, I was entering middle school at the same time (grade 5 was the first year of middle school for people in my area). I went to an elementary school that held students that could go to either of the 2 middle schools close by. All of my close friends went to the other middle school, leaving me with only my older friend and neighbor at the time. She took a turn for the worst, and began bullying me to look cool in front of her friends. On top of that, I was bullied by people in my class for being weird and having no friends. When I tried to reach out for help, my parents told me to suck it up &amp; get over it, while my school counselor ignored me. My teachers were also fed up with my drop in grades and lack of focus in class. Every night, I would begin to fantasize about running into the kitchen and stabbing myself with a chef‚Äôs knife. I had no idea what suicide was. 

After 6 months, I eventually made a friend, and began to recover. 

At the end of my 7th grade year, we were planning a long-distance move. I wasn‚Äôt too worried, and made sure to watch my mental health very carefully. 

I made friends very quick in my new school, and was happy for the first few months. Then it all went south again. 

My family was staying with my grandparents until we could get a place of our own again, and they would somehow find a way to tear apart everything that kept me sane. It felt like I was constantly being watched and judged, and if I ever made a single step out of line, they would turn my whole family against me. It was hell. 

After a year, we moved out into our own place, but this required changing schools again, so I had to say goodbye to my friends again. 9th grade was a horrible year for me, where I just felt depressed all the time. Now, I‚Äôve been harming since January, and have nothing left to live for. I‚Äôm looking for any way out, but there‚Äôs no active railroads close by, no harmful medications for me to OD on, and no rope to go hang myself with. I‚Äôm completely trapped. 

I‚Äôm looking for someone who can just tell me I‚Äôm not crazy. But I don‚Äôt need anyone to try and talk me out of it. It doesn‚Äôt get any better. I‚Äôve lied to myself for too long.

Ever since then I have this problem that i just get very sad and hurt by very small things, and recently ive developed a new coping method, whenever this happens and i get  really sad, i think about my ex and how i really loved her and how this small thing thats making me sad is nothing compared to my lost love, and it actually makes me feel a little better than before.

300942,"Hey, I'm a dumbass teenager who's friends with a horrible person. Warning: Long

Some background, I'm 15M and she's 13F, 9th and 8th graders. We haven't known each other for a while or anything (not even half a year), but we met through the venting channel of a discord server so we've known each other really well for a while. We're also online friends obviously and live hundreds of miles away.

First of all, she's really screwed up mentally, and has a lot of issues. She's addicted to vaping, self harm, has dabbled with another drug or two (i.e. cough syrup), has an awful relationship with her brother, very depressed, anxious and stressed, I think has been diagnosed with SAD and GAD, doesn't drink enough water, eats little, has attempted overdosing (at 12 years old), probably has ADHD, and I think there's a chance she's sociopathic. Her dad also died when she was 2, and yeah you get the deal. I've tried helping her a ton, too much actually lol. I tried reminding her to do get things done and even created a google doc to keep track of things, but it just isn't worth it since I'm not her therapist or anything, and she doesn't want me trying to help that much anyway lol. I've talked her out of killing herself, and I've given her advice dozens of times. She appreciates it, and trusts me a lot.

On the other hand, she isn't a good person. When I first started talking to her I thought she was just being self deprecating, but I've figured out over time that that isn't exactly true. She can be rude, she's wanted to kill before, she lies a lot (mainly to other people), and she lacks empathy in certain situations. I've had to talk her out of killing her brother one night when she was angry at him, no joke. Luckily, she isn't consistently homicidal, and I'm pretty sure she's never made plans. She's the last person you want angry, and she has no remorse when she is angry. Overall, she's fucking crazy.

With all of this in mind, I'm really close to her, since we both vent to each other a bunch. She's the only person I feel comfortable just randomly talking/venting to, and I'm probably the only person she goes to for advice, or when she feels absolutely suicidal. And even though we're pretty different people, we have some core similarities, and we can definitely agree on a few topics. She's honestly a really fun person to talk to, sadly. If it wasn't for this, and for how bad I feel for her, I would've dropped her out of my life already. Idk what to do with her, I talk to her several times a day and it'd be so hard to just suddenly stop talking to her due to how she's a bad influence and a bad person. Should I just talk a lot less and keep a distance, or what? idfk what to do and how to do it

TLDR: My friend is a bad person who is homicidal, and has a ton of mental issues which I try to help her through. Because we're so close, it's hard to just drop her out of my life or anything, and idk what to do.",non-suicide

I have a small family. A mom who spends her entire days on the computer with her crime sleuthing forum, or bitching at me. My little sister who use to think the world of me rarely picks up the phone anymore. My aunt who was a second mom to me passed away in march.

I'm 27 and I spent the last 5 years of my life in a deep dark depression I can't escape. I turned to alcohol and ruined any relationships I had left. I ruined my relationship with a guy I love so much. He won't even talk to me anymore and keeps me hanging on a string with ""maybe"" responses. I can't even escape by sleeping because I will either dream about him or my aunt and I just wake up crying. 

I feel like any day now I'm going to loose it and quit my job and end it all. I don't even have a decent schedule or routine. I'm not eating or doing anything. Nothing gives me joy anymore. Crying seems futile. This is the first time I can't even cry. Nothing bad happened today I just feel completely numb.

She was no longer the kind mom that would surprise me with a trip to the movies and tuck me in at night with hugs and kisses. My childhood was put to a halt and I was forced to grow up. We were doing good financially until it plummeted and we were in the negatives, and we're still on a strictly tight budget.

The only friend and person I could find comfort in moved away, and changed into a person I hardly recognize.

Not only that, but in late September of this year, I began to get violent migraines. I would pass out at school, get tunnel vision and I was lucky to get 5 minutes of sleep each night. I  had to miss a lot of school so I could just lay in a dark room with the covers over my head, waiting for it to go away. It did not go until I had to go to the emergency room to get an IV stuck in my arm.

Rumors were going around among the teachers and students that I was a stupid loser. My friends rejected me and said that I was faking it to get attention.

Then I got back on track, but only for 3 days. I had to have surgery to remove a fibroma from my back. It took another 2 weeks to heal and I faced even more hate emanating from my friends and mentors.

The migraines came back and I'm more behind than ever in my studies. I can hardly keep any food down and I've lots tons of weight, no matter how hard I try I can't seem to gain any.

A guy I met love bombed me with tons of adoration and attention. Stated he was serious about me and wanted a long term relationship with me. I believed him. But I later learned he has a girlfriend whom I now know is pregnant. He seems very smitten with her based on IG posts. Yet, he was keeping me on the side for sex. Initially I didn't realize he was turning me into a booty call but I figured it out. I just noticed he would never follow through on date plans with me.

He recently returned to our old job. On day 1 he approached me wanting to have sex at work. He was extremely aggressive with throwing me on the desk and was yanking my clothes off me. I just weakly and stupidly gave in. 

I feel really depressed, vulnerable and disgusted with myself for allowing this unhealthy relationship to go on for as long as it did. While I should not care...I feel bad that the guy probably thinks of me as a slut or whore. 

I already have poor self esteem and depression for other reasons like having little family or friends. I often feel very lonely. It's been really hard for me to function or get out of bed. I've missed work and school days too.

I did muster up the strength to tell the guy about a week ago that the situation was not working for me and I wanted more than sex. And we needed to move on from each other. Of course he pretended he was hurt or will tell me lies that he's interested in more with me. 

Well we worked together yesterday for the 2nd time and he said not one word to me. For some reason this also hurt my feelings. It was like he ignored me. I shouldn't care but it reinforced my belief that he sees me as worthless and just a piece of ass perhaps. It hurts because he is smart and knows what he is doing. 

At the moment I mostly hate myself for not having a backbone and letting myself get shitted on. I wish I loved myself more. At the moment I just want to go to sleep and die.

Hello r/suicideWatch! 

How was your day? I hope all of you had a lovely day. I didn't have such a great day myself. I begin school in two weeks, and I'm trying my best to wake up at a reasonable hour, but it's very difficult for me, as I've had a severe sleep disorder since childhood. This has me very stressed. This is truly wearing down on my mental stability. 

I didn't eat much today. I had 2 cups of moringa green tea this afternoon, then ended up going to Texas Roadhouse and having some delicious food, but I felt a tad bit disappointed in myself. I planned not eating today, but my family is rather suspicious of my poor eating habits. I honestly didn't feel like leaving my room today, but my family would get quite upset with me if I didn't. 

Anyway, I'm very tired; I'm going to make a cup of chamomile tea then get some rest. Maybe tomorrow will be a better day.

Sincerely,

Thomas.",suicide

If there is nothing after, then why does it matter? It's not like I'll see them suffer without me. It won't matter. My brain would be dead and feelings of regret wouldn't exist.

49750,"Need help regarding parents.Today I woke up to a frantic text message from my dad saying to call my mom immediately saying she was having a break-down and was going to commit suicide.

Along with that message I had also received many from my mother saying things such as you are a wonderful son and that the family dog belongs to me and other things of the such.

So I call my mother and I can hear the tears in her voice. She said everything is fine and that I don't have to worry. I asked her if she was 100% positive and she said yes. I also asked her what exactly was going on and she kept repeating ""I can't talk to my children about it."" I told her to please call me(or my sister or grandma or just anyone) at any point if she needed to talk to someone. She assured me she would be fine so I told her I love her and we ended the conversation.

After the conversation with my mother I asked my dad if he was okay and he just replied ""No"". I then texted him asking what was going on and he didn't respond. At this point me and my sister were talking to each other trying to figure out what the hell was going on.

About 30 minutes ago I receive a call from my mother. When I answered the phone I feared the worst when the person on the other end of the line was a male. He introduced himself as a deputy or officer or something. At this point I thought ""Oh no. My mother killed herself."" He goes on to tell me that my parents had been in a heated argument that was followed by my mom drinking and taking pills in a possible suicide attempt. He also told me that my father appeared to have tried the same thing. He told me that they were both fine in the hospital and would be sent to a mental clinic for evaluation and I probably would not be able to hear from them for at least 3 days. I thanked the officer very much for filling me in on the situation and then the conversation ended.

Right now I am in complete shock. I can't really say I am emotional but I have shed a tear or two in the past few minutes. I just don't know what to do right now. There are so many thoughts going through my head. I am supposed to be studying for a very difficult organic chem exam that is in 4 days (I a a junior in college). I can't even think straight let alone study and as I type this I feel like a selfish asshole for even bringing that up! My parents both just attempted suicide and all I can think about is how I am going to even pretend I care about the rest of this semester. I am calling the student counseling center first thing tomorrow (they are already closed) and setting up an emergency appointment to discuss this with a counselor and discuss how to go about the rest of the semester.

Besides my sister, you guys are the only ones who know about this right now. I don't really think I want to even talk to my closest friends or even my best friend/roommate about it. Like I said, I am just in shock right now drinking a beer trying to mellow myself out.

I should also add that I am not remotely suicidal and that it is not on my mind at all. I just thought I should say that so people don't worry about me in that sense.

Has anyone ever been in a situation like this? What should I do right now regarding my parents when they get out in the next week? Sorry this is really winded and confusing but this just happened very recently and I just wanted to let someone know. Thank you very much for listening. This is a wonderful subreddit and I appreciate everyone who is an active member. You guys don't realize how wonderful you are.

TL;DR received a call 30min ago saying parents both attempted suicide and are fine now but will be taken to a mental hospital for evaluation. ",suicide

I have reasons that I typed up, it was long as fuck frankly, but through some kind of keyboard glitch (bad usb port) it all got deleted and I don't even remember what I said

I don't want to be coerced into being okay with living
It's all just slavery from the ground up
We probably died before and this is hell, the good shit only exists to tempt you into staying, carrot and stick

I need advice on one specific thing
I don't understand why people think suicide is wrong, or bad. There is one thing holding me back (well, two things, but one is an inevitability though I fear it). It would hurt someone who I love a lot. I don't understand it. From my perspective, it seems as if I'm forced into existing, then when I take initiative to leave, they are forced into feeling pain because of it. Everything is fucking forced. See what I'm saying? We're all fucking slaves. I don't know how to change this but it's the only way because one day I'm going to snap and just do it anyway, and that would be very, very wrong. It's going to happen. How can I make someone else not hurt because of it? I don't get it, they should be happy that I'm doing what I want and that I'm free from a life I will never understand. But grief is such a deep, visceral thing. It's just the fucking cherry on top. Entering hurts, exiting hurts. It all fucking hurts. I don't want to leave some abyssal void behind me but I feel like I AM one already, and if I were to force myself to not be one then I'd just be going along with the coercion because it is not who I am (which was never my choice anyway!).

What do?
This honestly might be the wrong place but there's never anywhere anymore where you can have a serious discussion about this shit. It's all -controlled- like everything else.",suicide

I have been feeling extremely miserable and struggling with some assignments at college. I think I have asked my peers for homework help too many times and some are deliberately shunning me.

I sometimes think that ADHD is a fucking joke where people see you as crying wolf all the time due to the fucking nature of this disorder. I've only been diagnosed within two months and my parents shamed me into thinking that I have not been trying hard enough. They never see the aspects where I am slowly improving and it seems like they are expecting some miracle where I will suddenly become perfect.

To them, it is always my fucking fault. My country doesn't have cognitive behavioral therapy so I have been seeking help from a therapist at my uni. I didn't really click with her. On the suggestion of my psychiatrist, I asked for a therapist change. Only one person is in charge of the administration there and she ignored. When I told my parents this, it is my fucking fault again.

My parents really distrust my psychiatrist and think that she lied about how the public healthcare system does not accept ADHD patients and now I don't know if I can trust my doc as well. My parents also think that I am deliberately lying about my problems so that she feels sorry for me.

some background info: i‚Äôm 17 years old and in my senior year of high school. this years been going absolutely terribly. i decided in december i was gonna plan my suicide date in early february for a couple of reasons i wont get into.

on friday i was called into my guidance counselors office. hes a really nice guy and i like him a lot. he mostly asked me about setting up a time for taking my civics test but also asked if everything was okay because my grades dropped really bad. i told him i was fine and that senioritis just set in early. he asked me to meet with him again on monday to follow up.

after i left, a teacher i really love and trust stopped me in the hall and asked me about my college applications. see, she wrote one of my letters of recommendation and the sight we use to upload college apps lets her see if i‚Äôve applied with it to any college. she asked why it still says i havent applied and i lied and said i wasnt sure and that id ask my guidance counselor about it. i haven‚Äôt done a single application. i stoppt seeing the point after a while.

anyways this all kinda broke me because i‚Äôve been avoiding the crushing guilt of my subpar worl ethic and performance as of late. i ran into my friend and she could see something was wrong and asked me what was up. and i broke down right then and there. i told her everything, including about how i had a suicide date planned in two weeks and that i havent turned in any college apps because of that, that i had everything figured out and i was going to go through with it.

she was about to take me to the school psychologist right then and there but i begged her not to. we both know i‚Äôd most likely be hospitalized and as stupid as this fucking sounds i had a concert i wanted to go to this weekend. im not even going anymore because of the ridiculous snow. i know she didnt want to postpone it but she said the day we get back to school she‚Äôs taking me. 

but now my report card came in and im freaking the fuck out. im having a breakdown and i know im being dramatic but i feel like i cant do this anymore. my parents are gonna be so fucking pissed at me (btw i love them a lot, theyre not abusive or anything. just disappointed in me). im finding it harder and harder to wait, but i know my friend will blame herself forever if i go through with it today.

Now everytime i have a guidance meeting i get an half anxiety attack, my heart is my troat, i am sweating, i feel dizzy, i breathe like i just ran a marathon. 
The same is with math, everytime i hear my math teacher her voice it happens ( i have a bad experience with math)

Why am i like.this, do you experience the same?",non-suicide
189067,"I just want to be done (not urgent)I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm doing posting this. I‚Äôm only vaguely suicidal but after so many attempts I feel...different...about this.

I haven‚Äôt done anything yet, and honestly I‚Äôm waiting until the hospital is more safe. I don‚Äôt want to be saved only to end up with covid-19 and on a ventilator or something with people wasting their time trying to save me when I don‚Äôt want to be saved.

I don‚Äôt even have a complete plan yet. It‚Äôs starting to form but it‚Äôs still out of focus, hazy like my mind. I‚Äôm considering using multiple methods all at once, to make it less likely that I will survive. I have it narrowed down to my top three but I don‚Äôt have a date or location. Can‚Äôt do it at home because I live with my mom who works from home. I don‚Äôt want her to be the one to find me.

I guess I just wanted to tell someone who can‚Äôt lock me up in a psychiatric facility. 

Maybe I should talk about why?

Been struggling with mental illness since age 12/13. Some doctors claim that I am schizoaffective, others say that I am bipolar, and still others have written me off as BPD. So many words to say I‚Äôve been primarily depressed for about 18 years, have experienced delusions, and used to have a desperate fear of abandonment. One thing everyone agrees on is that I have severe anxiety to the point of being on disability. That‚Äôs why I live with my mom at age 30. I can‚Äôt work or hardly even go out without a person with me.
I also have an eating disorder that has come and gone for around 15 years now. I use substances to get out of my head, mostly over the counter stuff, and drink when I can afford to. Used to be extremely promiscuous and feel disgusting about my past. I was molested and raped as a child by a neighbor, and sexually assaulted by a friend in college. 

I just found out that I have polyps and a uterine fibroid. I need surgery. I hope that I am dead before then or that there will be anesthesia complications and I will die during surgery. I‚Äôve been bleeding since middle of March and it just won‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôm anemic and I‚Äôm tired and cold and weak. I just...I‚Äôm a fucking mess.

The behaviors and posts of so many people here is just crazy, I don't know how some of you are allowed in social media.

The difference is that at least most incels are self aware but you guys just don't notice.

No, not all women only want sex.
No, not all women only like ""chads"" (which, btw, most of those people you call chads are just popular because they're funny and unlike you, they have a personality)
No, not all women hate short dudes.
And no, not all women bad and boring.
If you actually got out of your house and interacted with people you'd realize it's your fault people don't talk to you, if you didn't answer in a monotone and harsh manner to people everytime they talked and stopped thinking they just want to insult you, you'd actually have friends.
And also, if a girl doesn't like you, it's not because you're ugly, it's not because you're under 6 feet, it's not because of your posture, it's because of your manners and they way you mistreat her.

147202,"Time is almost upSo... I'm planning to finish it all in about a month. Before I go, I wanted to leave my story somewhere. Hopefully, someone here might be able to help me out although I don't really expect so much.

I am 23M now, and was born in S.Korea from average family. My family including my parents and two brothers is mostly quiet but I know we do care for each other. From very young age, I was interested in science, and aimed to become a scientist. There are high schools specifically aimed to raise talented scientific students in my county and obviously, my goal was to get in there. It was extremely competitive thing and I studied hard. Fortunately, I was good at learning and always got in top 10 in my school. However, things happened and my family had to move to China for few years. In China, I went to Harrow Beijing, British international school, from Y9-Y11. At first, I had hard time fitting in since my English was not good back then, but once I got used to it, I enjoyed many aspects of it. Harrow is where I learned my country's education framework sucks and to stop by from studying from time to time and enjoy the life. I would say Harrow enlightened me whether for good or bad.

After 3 years of freshing experience at Harrow, life thing happened again and my family had to get back to SKorea. Obviously, I was too late to enter science specialized high school and went to just an ordinary high school in my country. Some people might already know, but the education in S.Korea is extremely harsh. Students were obligated to remain in school untill late at night. I'm talking about 9AM - 11PM. It was insane. I again had trouble adapting to this new system but this time it was more complicated. Studying all day at the school was obviously painful both mentally and physically but it was more than that. Harrow taught me critical thinking and things about life and that made me question if all this hard work is really worth it. I think at this point, I was really depressed continuously pondering about the life and death. Still, I could hold on to something. I was really into cosmology at that time, and just thinking about it made me excited. I still had a reason to stay alive. After 1.5yrs, I graduated and finally entered college.

My college was one of the best in my country and it was especially speciallized in science and technology. So I could say I was successful, or at least I achieved my first goal. The college life was refreshing again. I had lots of free time doing whatever I want, lived far from home in dormitary with roommates I came to become close to and joined clubs with shared interest people. I, still, was worried about the studies since it was bascially bunch of elitists from all around my country. To my surprise, I had absoultely no problem understanding lectures and got fairly good grades from all subjects. My first year in the college passed like that untroubled.

From the year after, however, I would say I was not living a healthy life. I had much less chances to meet my friends as we got separate majors (in my college, first graders all share most of the lectures and we choose our major from the next year). They also all had their roommates reserved for their best friends, so I had to live with random roommates. For some reasons, I had trouble making friends from new people I met in new lectures. The same went for my new roommates. We barely talked to each other and lived their own lives. I guess this is the point when I started to feel truly alone and hang on to my old friends. Depression did not really help with my studies also. I felt less motivated and for the first time in my life started to have some difficulties understanding things in lecture. Still, it wasn't worst. I got fair grades somehow. Not so good, but not so bad. Just average results. However, I still had hopes of studying cosmology and that made me keep going somehow.

As some of you might have guessed, it didn't get better the next year. I still couldn't make new friends and my friends decided to focus on studying, and we barely hung out together. My roommate spent most of the time outside, even spending night somewhere else. I got more depressed each day and spent most of my time playing games in my room alone. My motivation almost ran out and I started to miss out lectures. Still at this point, I had some hope left. I continued on. But it was the sixth semester. It was the climax. I had absolutely no contact with my friends for three whole months. Instead I tried to motivate myself in studying and got fairly good grades at mid exam. I would say, I was lonely and depressed but hopeful. Then, for unknown reason it exploded. I lost my emotions. To be more precise, I was crying in the bed everyday before, but at some point, I felt no more loneliness, depression and hope. I suddenly lost all my urges to do anythings. I didn't want to study, didn't want to go out and didn't even want to play. Everything was void. I missed most of the classes, never finished homwork and finally failed my finals. And I didn't care. I would just stay in my room stare at empty space for an hour or so. Every time I do anything, it was so much stress. I just wanted to vanish.

Since then, I'm having break from school for over 2 years now. I feel a bit calm at home fortunately, but I still have no motivation to live. I just let time pass by. For these 2 years, I always wanted to disappear from this world, and half a year ago, I finally began to consider suicide seriously. Now, I AM suicidal. I plan to die at some point in march this year despite the fear of pain and consequences of death. And before you ask, I've been to therapists and Department of Mental Health Medicine for treatments. You know what. The pills I'm still taking do not seem to have any affect. Therapists admitted that they can't seem to help me and introduced new therapists. Current therapist also have difficulties determining my state. I also tried some on my own. I tried to do some exercise, but the physical tiredness just makes me so stressful. Same goes for hobbies. I tried to draw or something but they gave so much stress that my head starts to hurt. For past few months, I worked on my last resort. I tried to get what I really wanted to before if that might help, but financial issues made them to go all in vain. Now, I can't think of anything I can try. Clock's ticking towards my Dday and now I'm preaparing to let everything go.

So... that's my whole story. Unlike may other in this thread, my life was not so troubled. I had no childhood abuse, trauma of something or lost something/someone important. It was just loneliness but I endured it for years, I don't think that was the real reason behind it. I can't even... know what caused this, what is wrong and how I would want to be. I just feel like... I don't fit into this world really that it was eventually to happen at some point. I don't know now. I am just too tired, I want to finish it all. And thinking that I'm gonna die soon makes me both worried and relieved. Sorry and thanks for reading my long post. It is somewhat my last attempt before I let everything go, so I'm open for talk although I doubt it would make any differences. Well, I failed but I hope anyone here who needs help gets better.

224348,"I'm relatively new here, but I've seen enough for a life time of sadness. Here is a thought.I'll be brief.

Depression.

That's a taboo word these days, isn't it?

""Depressed? What do you have to be depressed about?""

It seems like everybody knows your depression better than you do, doesn't it? Which is weird. The word depression induces an awkwardness as if it's an indelible mark of shame on your reputation as a person, much akin to wearing a post-it note from your mom everywhere you go that says ""I'm glad you stopped wetting the bed."" 

It's difficult to get rid of it. It's difficult to be happy about it. It's like part of you that's unrelenting and, like cancer, could sprout up against. And you become afraid of it. Afraid that you might relapse. That you might...somehow be weak enough for it to conquer you once more. 

Personally, I'm not afraid. Rather, I embrace it. Depression to me isn't a fever that consumes me anymore, but a tickling of the ribs. It makes me laugh. **My depression** makes me laugh. Don't confuse that with your depression. I own my depression, and I'm proud to acknowledge it. Why? Because I've passed it. I've reached over to my depression, gave it a hard look, and laughed at it. As if it meant held little power. And it does hold little power. So when you talk about depression, don't forgo the thought of discussion your own. Because it's part of you. It's made you stronger. When you know extreme sadness, then happiness is bliss. And when you know bliss, there's absolutely no reason to ever get familiar with extreme sadness ever again.

So. Feel proud of your depression. Feel proud that you've conquered something to massive and internal. Feel proud to tell others that you suffered through it. And even if they don't understand in the same way that us SuicideWatchers do, feel proud that you were able to admit to it. Live through it. And come out much more stronger than you entered it. 

You're all amazing people. It's a damn fine thing that nobody goes through the same unique situation. Because when you come out, you're unique. That's right. You are unique. Cherish that though. Be proud of yourself. ",suicide

I've been thinking about suicide since I was probably 11. I want to kill myself more than anything in the world. The only thing that stops me is my mom. I love her so much, she's my best friend, and I know it would absolutely kill her, especially since she suffers from depression just like I do.

i'm so scared though. i don't know what to do or how to make it stop or anything.

EDIT:

Today I got really close. I'm not relieved I didn't kill myself. I'm actually frustrated and sad. I didn't get a chance to attempt because my parents interrupted me before I could start.

I was in a place where i realized i don't want anything. I don't want to work, to study, or be succesful, to fulfill any dreams, to be in love with someone, to have a future .I was in a lot of pain, but hesitating becuase my preperation aren't done for my plan, then my parents came over unrelatedly and mom freaked at me for some stupid thing not being clean (I'm legal but visiting home). So i cried a bit at all of it, and got the whole ""Suicide is a sin"" and by implication ""Self-harming is wrong"" speech. She also has threatened to commit me if I ever admit to her that I am a danger to myself.

So my mom tells me to meet with this pastor who's just going to tell me the same things. my family's religious, and many people's opinion of my pain is that i just need to trust god more, or be more spiritual, or that ""All things work out for good.""

Too bad I'm sort of becoming an atheist for other reasons. 

Anyway, I'm upset, beause the only thing I want is to die. That's literally the **only** desire I have. And I don't have the balls yet to actually kill myself. The only solace I have is that if I got pushed a little farther and had some alcohol, maybe i could do it. But it's hard and it hurts so much to be alive. 

It hurts too because since I cried earlier, now I ""feel better."" But nothings hanged, and I dont want to feel better....I wantthe problem to be solved by me being dead. i guess i just need to  drink more next time and jave it ready.
Thank you

TL:DR **I am in a living nightmare, where the only thing I want is death, but I am guilt tripped into staying, and also I'm to weak to do it, and that hurts. I feel guilty for wanting to die, and for not trying to get better. I feel ""better"" now because i cried, but i don't want to ""feel better,"" temporarily or een get better... I want it to be over and to die.**

It is my first relationship. First year of college. It is a long distance relationship.

Well it ended. And right now I have no idea what I feel. I actually feel numb. When she said she wanted to end the relationship I actually thought the situation was interesting. That everything led up to that because I asked about something last night. I blame myself for has happened. It is my fault and I understand that. However, I just want to vent for now. I think one of the most hurtful comments was ""this is why you never have sex with a virgin"". The look that she gave me when she said ""do not touch me"" was...horrible. I acted mature when talking with her. Wanting to resolve our issue. She took that as me being too clingy. I should state this now: our relationship is non committed / not long term relationship. Me asking where our relationship was at / how she felt of me is what took this relationship south.

Maybe I was too clingy. Well obviously since doesn't want to continue the relationship. I never expected from me wanting to talk about our relationship it would lead to this breakdown. It's interesting how me caring about her drove us apart which actually makes sense if I look at it from her view. I visit, (we have had previous arguments about clinginess), ask her about the relationship, she takes it as me being clingy, and bam. Relationship in shambles.
You know what she told me when I realized I should just leave the room? She was sitting there and looked sad. She had been biting her finger tips till they bled. I didn't want to just leave her like that so I asked her for a hug. She asked me, ""why?"". I responded with ""so I don't just leave you in shambles"". She does this slight laugh and tells me ""are you sure you aren't the one in shambles"". This oddly hurt. I mean not as much as her telling me to never touch her and giving me that look of hurt. That look of hurt after I tried to hug her...it was like I tore out her heart. She looked like a hurt puppy with the way she put her arms to her chest. I can't believe I hurt her that much. The thing is...I shouldn't feel so hurt by this. We were in a non committed relationship and just the fact that she has been this influential to cause this feeling means I was becoming too attached. I blame myself. It's a shame.

(as of now I am now feeling very sad than I was when I started writing this)

If anyone has time to just talk via PM please let me know. I just really need to talk to someone.

122598,"Youtube or TikTok? Okay now I got you here furious wanting to comment ""YOUTUBE! DUHHH!"". Welcome :)

I've got a realistic question. What would be an easier platform to become famous? If we look at TikTok, it's still in an early stage so you don't have TOO much of competition yet. And it's rapidly growing in downloaders and whenever u make a ""TikTok"", pushing your videos to other users.

On the other hand we got Youtube. A platform wich is (in my opinion) way more fun. But Youtube has A LOT of competition, since it's already been here for years. Plus Youtube has had it's prime years and isn't growing tooooo much anymore (Not sure though). Also caused by the new adsense and all of that stuff.

So I'm asking for your vision, opinion, just your thoughts on this subject. And I know it's hard to see TikTok as a ""standard"" platform, since I dislike it as well. But please try to look at it realistically. Will TikTok die eventually or will the reign of Youtube take a knee?

So, on what platform is it easier to ""break out"" in 2020?

52769,"There just isn't any hopeAlright, SW, I've lurked here for awhile and I know the kind of comments I'm going to be getting to this. I'm not even really sure why I'm doing it. Maybe just so that somebody, somewhere, hears that I'm having a hard time? Whatever.

Basically, I'm in my late 20s, and I graduated from a top 10 law school in Spring of 2009. I got good grades, and have been an over-achiever from elementary school on. I was valedictorian of my high school, for instance. But today, and for the past year and a half I've been unemployed. I don't see this changing any time soon.

I can't count how many applications I sent out (although I can count the number of interviews I've had) and the worst thing about this is that this situation is my own fault. Now, it is true that I graduated in the midst of the worst economy most people can remember, but there were a series of bad decisions I made that put me in this position. Put succinctly, I underestimated the depth of the economic down turn and I turned down two offers of employment. One right before graduation and one right after. These decisions were probably the worst ones that I have ever made.

So now, I'm living with my in-laws. I have no job prospects, and, given the job market for lawyers, am unlikely to ever have any. My priorities have always been about personal accomplishments, my career, my upward potential. But now I'm faced with a lifetime of poverty, and, at best, the prospect of being a ""failed lawyer."" 

Basically, life doesn't seem like its worth it like this. Life isn't worth the struggle, pain, and effort when failure is the result and can be the only result. I feel like its the 9th inning, my team has two outs and is down two runs and I strike out. So maybe the game should end, eh?

Yesterday I had a bad anxiety attack over a friend possibly having the coronavirus (he didn‚Äôt). I wanted to hurt myself so badly. I went to the hospital, and when I found out I literally lost my mind. I‚Äôve had a few traumatic experiences in hospitals; I once was so disoriented I forgot who I was and was screaming at nurses to tell me who I am; and another time I spent six days without sunlight and cried nearly constantly, both out of uncertainty as to when I would leave, and out of not being able to see my grandmother who is my favorite person. 

My dad is emotionally abusive/neglectful. He blames all my problems on me not controlling myself or not meditating. I never learned how to control my emotions, and it takes so much energy to try I‚Äôd rather just let them out. Lately I‚Äôve been noticing he is very miserable and he talks down to me a lot more than usual. Controlling me, lying about me to my own face. I can‚Äôt win with him.

Anyway, I asked for a ride in a cop car to the hospital. I was crying the whole time and I wanted the officers to shoot me or rape me. It felt so good when they patted me down because they were so close to groping my crotch and butt. 

While in the hospital I was very calm. I asked to stay alone with the people in the waiting room. Talking to the doctor felt nice. All in all I was there for about three hours.

I had an appointment with my psychiatrist earlier this morning. He changed my seroquel dose from 400mg to 600mg. I‚Äôm pretty sure it won‚Äôt do anything other than making me fat and tired.

Just an hour ago I overheard my dad talking to my grandmother. He said if I act out again in school, he‚Äôll send me to the hospital and he won‚Äôt let me come home. He doesn‚Äôt understand that I‚Äôm literally at my breaking point when it comes to school. The staff won‚Äôt leave me alone, even if I so much as walk out of the room to take a drink.

Don‚Äôt know if this is needed but I am a 17 year old male. I‚Äôve been severely depressed for about a year and a half now. It is currently my senior year. Last year I suffered from a horrible concussion which was given to me when a senior punted a football inside the super small locker room before PE at my school. The ball hit me on the forehead, I tripped on my pants (I was in the midst of changing) and I slammed the back of my head onto the wall behind me and then onto the concrete floor. I was unconscious for awhile. When I woke up nobody was in the room except for a teacher and my two friends. I don‚Äôt really remember much more of the day. I later was diagnosed with a severe concussion and am still mildly affected by it. I missed months of school and the person who punted the football (student body president, super popular) never apologized. It turns out he ran out of the room when it hit me and he went to play basketball. I managed to get through junior year and I took the ACT (I got into the school I wanted a few weeks ago). When my brain began to heal, I started to get severely depressed. I  actually began to get depressed a month before my concussion in October of 2018. I ended up breaking up with my girlfriend at homecoming that month because I felt I couldn‚Äôt put my all into our relationship. We are still good friends and she‚Äôs been supporting me. Anyways, my depression flared up in October of 2019, leading me to being put in a PHP (partial hospitalization program). I was going to the program which taught CBT and DBT skills during the day and going home during the night.   After two months of PHP, things weren‚Äôt looking so great. My care team switched my meds which in turn made me really suicidal and I began to self harm. At this time they decided to send me back to school. They said ‚Äúwe send suicidal people back to school all the time‚Äù I would self harm in school and have active thoughts. Eventually PHP wanted me to come back. A few days later, they decided to send me to the hospital. The issue is that it was a Friday night and no hospitals had beds. We had to drive to a northern suburb (don‚Äôt want to give away my location) and I was placed in the ER for 3 and a half days. They tried to send me to an inpatient hospital 2-3 hours away southward. I was eventually admitted to the hospital I was staying at on Monday. I stayed in inpatient for a full week and my meds were changed again. I began to have less suicidal thoughts and almost no self harm. I was able to spend time with my family over the holidays. I currently am back in school and it is finals starting this Tuesday. I just ended my time at PHP and am now doing an after school program at the same place. I am doing half days at school with only my needed classes to graduate. I currently am writing this instead of studying because I need to get it all off my chest. I just want to graduate and go to college. I‚Äôve missed so many classes that I may not be able to graduate. I truly am worried. I also can‚Äôt get the hospital out of my head. I feel like I have PTSD from it. I know this experience was mild compared to almost everyone else‚Äôs.

They're starting to forget important things more often. The grey in their hair, the wrinkles in their face, the cloudiness in their eyes.

Every phone call when they're away could just be the one that lets you know they were in a terrible accident. Every hour past the time they were supposed to be home could just be the day they don't make it home.

47649,"Been thinking a lot about this, especially latelyHonestly, I've been thinking a lot about suicide. I've been fairly depressed since I was around 10 or 11 (now 23/m/canada), but it never really affected my day-to-day life until recently. At 19, I had my first physical symptoms. And now that I'm 23, those symptoms are less prevalent. But what's more prevalent, are the social ramifications.  

I just recently (~2 months ago) removed everyone I knew from every major form of communication save for 8 people - 2 parents, 2 brothers, 1 brother's girlfriend, 1 cousin, and 3 friends I only see once every other month or so (one of which, once a year or less). Cell phone, facebook, gaming friends lists, twitter, etc. And the thing is, no one has tried to get in touch with me since. This makes me feel really shitty, to be honest.  

Work isn't much better. There are a few people I share lunch conversation with, but no one I'd consider a real friend (to hang out outside of work, for example). And they speak very negatively of anyone who they think has depression as ""complaining"" or ""gaming the system for sympathy"", which makes me very reluctant to become to involved in their life.  

It doesn't help that I really have no hobby besides gaming. I even tried joining a MeetUp for Introverts (before this, meetups for board gaming, Food, and Cinema have all been dead-ends because it's all people with pre-established relationships and anyone outside tends to get shunted, especially in larger groups like a Pub Night near where I leave), and that hasn't had anything really (only 1 meetup in the last 3 months since I joined).  

Volunteering isn't really an option, as most places require 3 hours twice a week and that's not really a commitment I'm willing to make (40 hour work weeks, and on the weekends I have plenty of chores from my parents, whom I live with atm). Even if it was, I feel like volunteering isn't really a social thing, either - to me, it feels like most volunteering is just free labour (desk clerk, sorting bin at a thrift store/Salvation Army, soup ladeling at homeless shelter, or portering at a local hospital).

So, yeah I've been thinking about ending it recently. It's gotten rather specific, which is what scares me. Don't think I can share specificities, but let's just say it involves exact locations and methods when normally it was just generalized in my head.  

Don't really know why I'm posting, mostly to see if anyone has any ideas or whether my situation is as dire as it seems.  

Just feels like I'll never really achieve what I want in life, I'm at a point where I feel like I can't really advance any farther.  

(What I want is a relationship, a family, and to travel with my S.O., btw. But I've never had a relationship, and at 23 it seems unlikely that someone would be willing to put up with someone so inexperienced. And I'm only getting older.)",suicide

EDIT:

I've been struggling a lot. This isn't the first time I've felt suicidal and hopeless.

I feel like i have hit the point where trying to bring it to an end is the only option i have. All my life i have been a mess, a fuck up as many would say.

I'd say most of it started when i was younger. I dont remember a lot of my childhood a lot of it is just blank but what i do remember is clear.

My Father was an abuse alcoholic. He beat on my mother for fun but as i was a child i couldn't do anything to help her. I had to witness it for years on end. As i got older it started to happen to me.
A few years later my mum moved us away from him (my younger sister remembers nothing which i'm happy about) She started her life over and met someone new.
He became my step-dad a few years later, so for maybe 4-5 years everything was great, my mum was happy, so was i.

They started to argue because of me and said i was the blame and everything that happened was all my fault and i was nothing but a waste of space and trouble.
About 14 i started to shut my self away from family and friends and ended up losing all my friends. Around the same time i was always sad, and having no one to talk i never really connected it to depression.
I was told ""your sad because you lock your self away all the time."" where really i locked my self away because of the way i was feeling but i wasn't always like that, sometimes i was over excited, happy, care free.

This went on for years and after a massive fight and argument, my mum told me,i was just like my dad and i should have been left with him to become a monster like he was and i was a massive mistake, then if it wasn't for my grandperants i would have never been born as i was evil spawn.
After years of being kicked out of home my aunty took my to a doctors as she believed there was more to the way i was feeling all the time.

After months of Drs, Therapists and so on, they said it was bi-polar. Which explained the mood swings and why i never really had a balance point between happy and sad.

I moved back home hoping this info would change things, stop the fights/arguments and hopefully they might understand I'm not being to way i am on purpose.
It changed for a while.
My meds got changed and things went backwards. I told the new Drs the meds ain't right they ain't working.
They basically point blank refused to put me on what i used to be on.

I ended up stopping all meds.

Since that day (which is now 7yrs plus) i managed to try and keep it under control by myself but I've gone to a worse state, worse than what i have ever been.

My good days are good. My bad days kill me. 
If i argue with my mum she tells me i was a mistake and life is better of without me and im not needed. Im a burden basicaly. 

I now spend so much time depressed its taken over me. 

I wake up most morning hoping it will be different or it will just end.
The pain of life its self, as that will ease the pain in my head.

Over the past few years the pain has got that bad, i've tried more than once to end it.
I've backed out a few times but the times i haven't, i felt peace and longing calm, only to wake up in hospital on drips and machines.

I always think about ending it and somedays the urge is more than others.

I never thought i would post this, or parts of my life

I never thought i would get a reply to my original post as it was vague and pathetic but someone messaged me and said that sometimes you just start writing and your mind lets loose.

So that is what I've done, and this is what i have. I've missed out many parts of my past but a lot of it is a repeat of its self.

I also have a reason for wanting to kill myself, it's because I truly think that there is no purpose in life, because there really isn't, and there are no cons to suicide except for hurting friends and family, and the pain of doing it to yourself physically. Those are the only things holding me back. The thought of someone approaching me and just shooting me in the head inst scary to me, I almost wish it would happen, so I wouldn't have to live this pointless life anymore. I have never been through therapy, but I believe that no amount of therapy will ""fix"" this, neither will any amount or type of medicine because it isn't a feeling, it's a belief that pushes me to want to kill myself, not a feeling. I've actually searched all over for the web for someone like me and I haven't found anything, can you even be depressed from thinking something likes this? Because I font think you can. This is not a joke, I'm being 100% serious. I've never have talked to anyone about this at all. I just need some help/advice. I just wanted to get this off my chest. Any replies at all will be appreciated. Thank you so much for reading.",suicide

128401,"I think I might have raped my girlfriend and I fucking hate myself right now...  

A little backstory, I'm a 15 year old boy and I've been in a relationship with this girl for a little over four months now.

A couple nights back, me and my girlfriend were laying on my bed chilling, when I was rubbing her ass and was feeling horny. I started rubbing around her clit area and I think by this point she had fallen asleep. I'm pretty sure that at one point I tried to finger her but didn't and rubbing around her clit area was as far as it went. When she woke up I felt instantly guilty and felt so awful. I cannot remember if I was fully aware that she was asleep or not but either way I felt like a horrible sex offender and almost burst into tears. I spoke to her about it shortly afterwards and she has told me that what I did does not violate her boundaries and even if I did finger her that would still have been consensual. She said that I should stop worrying and being anxious about it because I have done nothing wrong and have not violated her boundaries.

I still feel like the worst person on Earth and I deserve to be punished. What do people think about this, am I a rapist?",non-suicide

336763,"been having a lot of suicidal thoughts lately... this is pretty much a messy rant...These past couple of months have been rough I've lost motivation in everything i quit playing soccer, kickboxing, cooking, and many other things that made me genuinely happy, just because i can't drag myself out of my room.. i used to be so social and now i only talk to a few people nothing really makes me happy anymore all my life I've dealt with shit and never seemed to care but it's starting to get to me I'm 16 turning 17 pretty soon my mom is incredibly religious and homophobic and we get into fights a lot since i'm a lesbian and an atheist.. my entire life i've really had no one to talk to besides some close friends, whenever I go to my parents about something they always make it about themselves, i've asked for a therapist for my depression and to see someone for my ADHD as i can't even focus on simple things like school work, my mom refuses to get me medicine or to talk to someone about my feelings and my dad told me to get over it, a couple months ago my mom really nonchalantly asked me if i was gay i told her i was cause it seemed like maybe she wouldn't get mad but she immediately yelled at me and then ran into the bathroom to cry to jesus for three hours and that just made me feel great.. a lot of my issues steam from problems with my mother she constantly yells at me and my siblings though i'm the only one that stands up for my self and everyone else my mom has tried multiple times to physically assault my younger sister even going as far as to slam her against walls and try and choke her though i guess in her defense shes on a ton of medicine and loses her cool a lot every time this happens i protect my sister and usually end up pulling my mom off of her and getting hit instead and ending up with a bruise or two but thats only the physical side of my problems the constant yelling is almost worse since your not able to defend yourself in anyway or it makes it way worse though usually i speak up cause i dont want to take that shit so i get in a ton of trouble, i guess in my moms mind only her feelings matter as she can constantly say awful things about you and you cant say anything in return or she loses her shit thats usually how the fights start, she constantly tells me i dress like i worship the devil or that she wishes i dressed more like a girl even going as far to make fun of me and assume i'm transgender she'll say things like ""i sure hope your not gonna turn into a boy on me haha"" or making a joke about me being trans or something then when i reply that i'm not she'll pull out the ""are you sure lol"" ( i support trans people they're amazing its just mind blowing how insensitive my mom can be when she acts like shes a perfect parent). Shes even gone as far as to attack my friends and try and cut me off from them a few nights ago one of them was helping me with some homework it was about religon something i know nothing about and my mom comes in and is all like ""WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME FOR HELP"" and the proceeded to call my friend mind you a minor, a dick as a grown adult.. imagine having a parent who acts younger than you and has the mind-state of a fucking child also my dad always takes her side even when he knows shes wrong so he doesnt have to deal with her shit. (theres a lot more problems with my mom but no ones gonna read this so it doesnt really matter hopefully i get a therapist soon)   I also recently got into some trouble when my mom found out i was vaping (yes i know i shouldn't be doing it till 18 and no i'm not contemplating suicide over a juul) but it helps me focus since she wont let me get a prescription and it honestly takes away some of the emotional pain i'm feeling, but since this incident my mom has been constantly saying really mean things to me which make me feel even worse about the whole situation... but yeah suicide seems more appealing everyday just kinda needed to vent..",suicide

I took a blade out of some old razor and tested it out on the side of my hand. I can feel the wound everytime I flex my hand. It's a little uncomfortable I should've tested somewhere else.

Then I cut three small lines on my bicep, stupidly below the t-shirt line. I don't know why but watching it bleed felt really really good. It bled a lot. It didn't really hurt that much and I cleaned the cuts with antiseptic. That stung a bit. I washed the blade (with antiseptic again) and put it in a tissue in an old wallet and hid it on my wardrobe for next time. I'm sitting here looking at my handiwork and tbh I can't wait to do it again. I completely forgot about the pain. I know this isn't healthy but if I can't kill myself to stop the pain I can do this at least. They're only little cuts and I doubt they'll even scar. I'll do it somewhere else next time that can be hidden easily. I don't really care about scars since I made myself a deal that if I don't have a reason to live by twenty I'll just end it despite being a pussy.

There is no religion or belief system that can make my everyday life feel worth it, nor is there any activity or person on this earth that could do the same. I feel no pride in my work. I feel no passion. No motivation. No vision of a brighter future. No desire to get there even if the notion existed in my head.

I have so many money problems that I can't cope. I can't even afford to pay for my prescriptions. I'm in so much debt with the bank that even when I get paid from work I have no money I can use.

189490,"Failed againHas anyone here had near death experiences and wish they had not survived? I‚Äôve had a bunch and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm wired incorrectly, but looking back on everything brings me nothing except dread and pain. I‚Äôm old now and I‚Äôm starting to lose my looks and I‚Äôve accumulated a lot of brain damage. I was ‚Äúcanceled‚Äù by an ex friend who accused me of being a violent abuser when I declined her last request for money. And I‚Äôm honestly not the best person ever, it‚Äôs a shitty person thing for me to be sitting here posting and feeling depressed instead of doing the massive amount of work I need to do for my art hanging. I started life out with a lot of talent and threw it away with smoking and drugs and sex and idleness every chance I got and I‚Äôm still doing it. Except the sex, which was previously the only thing that made my life enjoyable but I‚Äôm terrified of now. I have severe OCD and probably undiagnosed aspergers. I am generally repellent to most people. But I can‚Äôt use it as an excuse. I really need a friend right now and I have friends who do care about me but I can‚Äôt weigh them down w more me problems. Suicide is the easiest thought to turn to because it always makes me a little happier, and that is incorrect but it‚Äôs almost like I press a button in my brain and feel a little wash of peace. I will not do it, I will work harder or not, maybe I‚Äôll just smoke increasingly more weed until I end up in the hospital again. I quit my job and make another long string of small but ruinous life decisions. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to be responsible for my life anymore. I wish I was in prison or in an institution or in grad school but I can‚Äôt even get my professors to respond to an email.",suicide

There's only one thing that could go wrong. If it goes wrong, that means all my possible ways of committing suicide are gone. I just hope it will work out this time around.

My plan is to tie my noose to the handle of my wardrobe, and then do that low suspension hanging method. I haven't tested it, so hopefully what I suspect may get in the way won't get in the way. On the plus side, no one will interrupt this time round.",suicide
283034,"Thinking about killing myselfRight now I'm thinking about attempting suicide again. It just seems like the best option. Im going to a therapist now after my boyfriend convinced me to go but that just brought along more problems. 

On the first appointment my dad didn't turn up. He said there's no point of going. Because apparently everything he said is right. And on Monday we had a massive argument. He tried to force me to tell him what was wrong. He kept shouting we aren't leaving here until you tell me what's wrong. So I tried to tell him something and started shouting ""why are you so upset about that stop being stupid"". We just sat there for ages arguing. And then he said ""to be honest i don't care jen. I don't care about any of this anymore. There's nothing wrong with you at all so cut the shit"". He walked off not really caring at all that I was crying. He still hasn't apologised and really I don't think I deserve one. 

Nothing really feels worth living for anymore. I just want it all to be over. Im sick of making other people sad. I need to do what is best and get rid of myself. No one needs me anyway.",suicide
177193,"Somewhere elseI've realized the trend. Almost every November I hit a low. Usually end up in the psych ward. Or at least the emergency room. I realized this two years ago. And I've gotten so good at keeping quiet now. Suppressing everything. But it's still there. Pounding through my head. I take out the blender, and imagine turning it on with my head inside. Could I scramble up my brains with my hair? We brought a saw into the basement. But I think, if we ever set it up properly, I could cut my whole head off while he's away. The one thing keeping me here dialing through the days is a dog. A very broken dog I adopted. He hates that dog. I love that dog. Could that dog recover without me? Would he still be on a warm bed at night? That dog deserves everything. I deserve to be dead. Without me alive, I think this dog will also die. But then we could be together somewhere else maybe? I can't do that to him. The dog needs more time.
He likes to shoot guns in the backyard. I've warned him for years that I have issues and, given an easy enough chance, I'd hold that pistol to my head and hope I can hear my skull burst before I dive into the wonderful blissful blackness. He wants me to get my pistol permit. The plan is to get through just a few more years. Pay off debt. Get my permit. Assuming my last hospital stay is far enough in the past and won't be brought up. And then I have no guilt to be here. He'll be fine without me. He can take my car. Pay the bills. And I won't even have to use his gun. I'll have my own. I'll have legal permission to gush my own brains and blood into my backyard.
But every year feels like it's getting harder. I'm not even a human anymore. I'm a shell filled with regret. I want a do-over. And it would be so easy, to ask to learn how to shoot. He'd probably be so happy. And when he looks away, I only need a second. Is there enough reason to stick out a few more years? I feel so lost.

161591,"The capitol wasn‚Äôt Christianity I feel like one of the greatest flaws of religion in America is how we shape God in our image,  instead not allow God to shape us. Instead of allowing God to change us, such as loving others as God tells us to, we change God to fit our agendas and worldview. While we see this in many places in the world, such as using homosexuality being a sin to excuse showing hatred towards others, or using Gods word to deceive and influence the masses, this has never been more prevalent than in politics. 

Republicans carrying a Jesus saves flag while storming the capitol, which resulted in needless deaths. Democrats ending prayer with amen and awomen( amen being a term which as nothing to do with gender).  Of course not everyone confirms this, and even if you‚Äôre Democrat or Republican, being these things doesn‚Äôt mean you agree with This. 


Let me say, what we saw at the capital  is not Christianity. Our weapons should not be physical, but spiritual. Our enemies aren‚Äôt physical ones, like your fellow man, but a force unseen. 

For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.‚Äù Ephesians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠6:12‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

We‚Äôve been called to love each other, our allies and our enemies. Even though I don‚Äôt see people of opposite beliefs( political, spiritual, etc) as enemies, even if we do, we are commanded to show love to them regardless. 

‚ÄúBut I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you! In that way, you will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven. For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike. If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much. If you are kind only to your friends, how are you different from anyone else? Even pagans do that.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Matthew‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠5:44-47‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NLT‚Ä¨‚Ä¨


TL;DR: As Christians, our enemies aren‚Äôt other people. The Capitol was an exalted what what it isn‚Äôt.  We have been commanded to love our enemies, so let‚Äôs do so.


That‚Äôs all I have to say, God bless and I love you all.",non-suicide
130472,"Read this or don't, life is pointless anyway.I don't want to die, I just don't want to live anymore. I took enough drugs that I just woke up after sleeping for 28 hours, and all I wanted was to do the same thing again. The worst thing in life isn't being suicidal, it's getting better and then realizing that you were just pretending to be better. Life isn't great. The people that have their shit together and go about their day and go to classes and do their homework and go out with their friends and graduate and get married and have children and buy a house and retire and then die are assholes.  How can they all possibly do that? How can you wake up in the morning and have the motivation to get out of bed and do the things you need to do? 


I hate everything. I hate being sober and I hate being alive and I hate that I have to do things that I don't want to do. I don't even want to post here, but there's nowhere else I can say all this crap without sounding but like an attention whore. I have no friends. Literally zero friends and not a single person I can talk to about anything of value. I spend my days going to college then going straight home back to bed. I sometimes have to hang out with my parents, but that really sucks because I have to pretend to be okay. I don't even want my cat anymore, who used to bring me so much joy and pleasure. I just want someone to come take her away so she's not stuck in the house where her owner is a miserable wreck.


I used to believe that my feelings were the cause of a chemical imbalance in my brain and that if I went to a psychiatrist then they could help me learn how to function again. I don't believe that anymore because psychiatrist are just regular people with their own problems trying to solve someone else's problems. 


I used to believe that if you surround yourself with positive people then their positivity can rub off on you. All I learned on that account is that positive people are just a different breed of humans that can somehow convince themselves that anything matters. 


I used to believe in love and family, but then I learned that love is a lie and your family is just stuck with you because you happen to share the same genes. 


I don't believe in anything anymore. I don't believe that life gets better. Everyone says that if you're suicidal then you have nothing left to lose and you can just go do whatever you want and eventually you'll find meaning to life again. Personally I think that's a load of crap. Life doesn't get better if you go do the things you normally wouldn't do in places you normally don't visit. All that does is make you miserable in another location. 


I just don't see the point of it all. What's the point of going to college, what's the point of eating, what's the point of leaving the house, what's the point of trying to find things to fill your time. Nothing gets better, and if you feel like it's getting better than you're just fooling yourself. I thought I was getting better, and I spent a few months being super motivated and super excited about life. And then I realized it's all just pointless. Life is just pointless. Everything sucks and then you die. But even killing yourself requires motivation, so I wish I just got hit by a car or something.


I used to be great. I don't mean that to sound like I'm bragging or anything, I seriously used to be great. I was always  smart, I was talented, I was pretty, I was good at school, I had lots of friends, I was social and I did things outside of my house, I was caring, I was kind, and I believed that my life was going to generally good. The past few days I have completely and utterly changed my outlook on life. No matter what I do I always end up back in the same place, here. I end up back at the realization that I don't matter and I never will. If I was gone the world would be exactly the same, the only difference being that for a few months my parents would be sad. Love and joy are a lie. In the grand scheme of things my existence doesn't matter.",suicide

103552,"It‚Äôs hard to believe this is real life, because it all feels like a nightmareI‚Äôm so tired of being alive.  I‚Äôve tried to end this so many times but it never works. If I told you an exact number you probably wouldn‚Äôt believe me, but trust me it‚Äôs a lot. Especially for someone my age. I have a full proof plan this time, I‚Äôm just not sure when to go ahead and do it. I want to live to see Halloween since it‚Äôs my second favorite holiday, but that also means I have to spend it completely alone, again.

So much has happened in my childhood, the past year, and all of this year.  I can‚Äôt go into detail because I don‚Äôt want this to be too long, but it‚Äôs all too much. I keep trying to make new friends and have a positive outlook, but that usually only lasts for a couple weeks or a month and then I‚Äôm back to being completely alone. I‚Äôve tried drugs to take my mind of things, and they do, but looking back on times I took drugs every night I feel like that‚Äôs made me detached from the person I once was. I used to be quite funny and charming I guess you could say. Now I just feel like a hollowed out shell that used to carry a nice personality. 

It‚Äôs surreal to believe this will be it. This will be the age I die. Because as a child I had many things I wanted to do when I grew up. I wanted to go see the country my family is from, I‚Äôve only heard about it in stories from my family. I wanted to study hard and eventually be a prosecutor. I wanted to find love and have a beautiful family. But the rosy image I once had of being an adult has faded. And now I just want to go to sleep. Dying before 15 is scary to some people I guess, but for me living past 15 is scary. 

So hopefully this will be my final attempt. Whenever that may be. I hope everyone reading this gets to live a life much more fulfilled and happy than I did. ",suicide

Unlike some people with mental issues but doesn't want to die, I feel like I'm the opposite. I don't think I'm depressed, at least, not full on, but I am extremely suicidal. I've got my shit ready, just waiting for that day now.

243282,"I'm still suicidalWe're wrapping up a family holiday, on a train back home. I've had an incredible time on this trip, I hiked a fairly difficult trail up Table Mountain, explored wine farms, went to the beach, and had a fantastic holiday all round. But as I was walking to the smoking section of the train I had the urge to open the door and jump out as another train was passing. At every. Fucking. Compartment.     



I was looking out the of the window lustfully, wondering how bad it'd hurt and if it'd be quick.
I've just had one of the best trips in a very long time, I've been extremely happy with my family, and I realised I'm still suicidal AF!     



What I don't get it how?? Why?! I've been going for therapy every single week for the past few months. I've been working through my issues. I have amazing support structures at home and at work which help me deal with the anxiety depression. I have an incredible family who I love very, very much and I still want to kill myself. Not a day goes by that I don't think about it.     


The only reason this incident stood out today is because I stood back and I was like ""Holy fuck, no. That'd be awfully gruesome and my baby cousins and little brother are in this train too, so let's NOT think about that, shannibell""     

  
I just don't know what to do. I really thought therapy was helping. I adore my psychologist. He is the only doctor who's been able to help me over the years. He is the first person I've chosen for myself (My parents had sent me to countless psychologists and psychiatrists in my teens). After my attempt 2 years ago I was put on very heavy medication, which I stopped taking over a year ago, and I've been doing just fine - I've been going out more, I've become more active, I do things that make me happy and surround myself with incredible people. I landed my dream job and I'm doing spectacularly for a 21 year old - my life is basically perfect and I STILL feel this way?
I'M NOT EVEN SAD ANYMORE, I JUST FEEL NOTHING?     



And I think I may just do it one of these days. I don't even feel sad/weird typing that out?! Just a morbid excitement and relief.     


Please help. I don't want to hurt the people who love and care about me. I saw how it broke them when I had my attempt a while back. I just feel like it's the only option I have left.

im also scared of not existing i guess. or what comes after death. if theres an afterlife i know i will go to hell. if reincarnation or whatever exists, im scared of ending up with an even worse life. not enough karma or whatever.

172003,"35 may as well be 80i wasted my teenage years and first years of my 20's recovering from chronic fatigue syndrome, having my dad die and then taking care of my mother 24/7 after six months after my dad died. i wasted my twenties by trying to work out what the fuck i had to do. my dad was 63 when i was born and retired by the time i was in school. he had lost his hearing in world war two. my mum was in her late 30's. when i was in grade 4 or 5 she had a massive mental breakdown (manic depression) and had to retire from being a 30+ year school teacher. she never worked again. As a child/teen I associated hard work with mental illness and personal tragedy because that's what i knew.  When i first started to be really good at something I got glandular fever which was later diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome. Just as I recovered from that Dad died suddenly. Six months later I took care of my mother 24/7. She died a week before my 22nd birthday. By that point i had no education - couldn't go to school when i was caring for her (was before i knew about distance ed.) - the next couple of years were trying to sort my life out. i got my vce. Someone from my past took pity on me and got me a job in the USA. 

I fucked that up. I had a stroke and lost my shit. Got involved with the wrong people - who took me in when i got out of hospital from my stroke (which cost me my job because i couldn't stay out on the road working it). I stayed in america rather than admitting defeat and going home back here to Australia. i ultimately went to jail for crimes they committed. because i couldn't prove that i was innocent didn't think i had a chance so i pleaded guilty before it even went to court. I did my time and got out. I wanted to redeem myself but of course that's easier said than done. I went back to school and got two university degrees - degrees in internet communications and professional writing and editing - great lot of good they'll do. arts degrees aren't worth the paper they're printed on. I'm halfway through a marketing degree (all started since I got out of prison).

i'm meant to be moving to brisbane next week with my partner of 4 years. the second they do a background check on me they'll find what happened to me overseas. well that's great - it means that we'll be trying to move states with her already having taken the position to improve her health and be homeless because nobodies going to rent out to a criminal. 

I cant get a real job so i do my best writing articles for websites. some freelance writer i am. 

i have cancer and the likelihood of recovery from that is low. i think i'm better off dead before it kills me slowly and i put my partner and family through even more grief.

27089,"Teacher trying to help a suicidal student, advice appreciatedApologies for the length of the post, but when a life is potentially on the line words are important. 

I'm a high school teacher (male) who just found out yesterday that my student (16yo female) is having serious suicidal thoughts. First time dealing with this situation and it's been pretty taxing. I'd really just appreciate advice on how to go about supporting my student.

We're doing Romeo and Juliet in class, she was all into it through the first couple weeks. Said she'd read it like 4 times and was super involved in the class, acting like herself. 

Then about two weeks ago she didn't participate anymore, seemed kind of not there. Yesterday we were acting out the final scene (with the double suicide) and she adamantly volunteered for the part of Juliet, and did it damn well. 

So I asked her how she had been and she hung back while the class let out for recess. Her friend was there at first.

""How have you been?""

""Not good.""

""Why not good?""

""Been thinking about my death.""

""Your death? What do you mean?""

Her friend: ""Yeah, she told me yesterday she would give me her makeup kit"" (this is definitely a prized possession, she does really cool fake blood zombie style makeup.) Friend left.

""Well, I was just thinking that I don't want to live anymore and that it would be fine if my mom went into my room to wake me up for school and saw me laying in bed covered in blood.""

Obviously that's a serious threat. She told me she had cut herself before. She has access to razor blades. This had the feeling of something that would happen the next day (today, Friday).

She expressed feelings of being alone, that nobody understands her. She's not like most 16 year old girls, has tons of personality. Reads anime, Stephen King novels, and 50 shades of Gray. Draws like a pro. Wrote a short horror story last year for English which was one of the best in a school competition. 

So we talked about that, I said she's an incredibly talented and interesting person, and I understand that people don't get her interests and that must be frustrating.

""Everybody wants me to act 'normal' and stop doing the stuff I like doing.""

Her other teachers are constantly on her ass about how she needs to act more like a girl her age.

Anyway, I came back at the end of the day and gave her my phone number, told her to call if she had any more thoughts about suicide or if she needed anything at all. She said ""really?"" with a tone that broke my heart.

**Day 2 (today, friday)**

Found out through some other students that somebody saw me give her my number, and she downplayed it in a group chat calling me creepy.

Saw her talking to another teacher, I suppose she told him what's up.

She was more active in class and seemed more responsive. She even drew me a picture, which I assume was her way of saying thanks.

We talked a few minutes at the end of the day.

""How are you feeling?""

No response.

""Are you feeling better or worse today?""

""About the same.""

""It takes time to feel better. It's okay.""

""Why does everybody want to help me?""

""Because we care about you (which I go on to explain from my point of view)""

""You don't have to be involved. I'm fine by myself I've been alone so long I've adapted.""

""I know I don't have to be, but I want to be. I want you to feel better. And it's one thing to be fine being alone, I can do that too, but if you're having these thoughts then something is wrong.""

""I don't know.""

""I just don't want you to do anything permanent. Things can get better.""

""You just can't understand what's going on in my head.""

""I know. I know. Honestly I'm not trying to understand, I'm trying to help you. Whatever I can do just let me know.""

She turned to get her stuff.

""I'm going to keep checking on you, okay.""

""My bus is going to leave.""

""See you Monday.""

And that's where I'm at. I have already talked to the school psychologist.

217832,"Routine Suicidal Thoughts and Self Harm, Looking for Coping Mechanisms25M in CA, USA

For the last 4 months I've been prone to impulsively harming myself. Generally a series of bad conversations and circumstances pushes me instantaneously into a depressive mood where I feel like a burden, I feel like I'm being told I'm fundamentally awful in an unchangeable way, etc. and to alleviate the torrent of anxiety and helplessness I find myself driven to slam my head into walls in an effort to achieve unconsciousness. A month and a half ago, I started cutting myself - the pain and terror of blood distract me from the sadness and replace it with terror and shame, shitty but much less shitty than risking suicide. I fear that if I leave this acute anxiety alone without attempting to mitigate that it will escalate to a full suicide attempt. In these moods I exclusively think about suicide and self harm, and for days afterwards suicide is a haunting whisper in my ear. The trigger for all of these is conflict with my girlfriend. I've talked to her about how I don't feel I'm not in a position to change my reactions (and I don't even fully believe that's possible) and that I need her to approach conflict differently, but whenever things get heated all bets are off and the same old shit leaves me on the floor, slamming my head into something, slicing myself with the nearest vaguely sharp object. This severe reaction I have to certain methods of conflict (notably raised voices, interruption, perceived condescension, and negative commentary on things that can't be changed) is not unique to this gf, this goes back to my father and I've had similar issues with other gfs in the past, but as I get older it gets worse and worse and this is the first time in my life that I regularly practice self-harm about it.

The fact of the matter is I am deeply in love, and I wish I wasn't. I wish I never met him, because I am going to lose him. And I sleep with that knowledge everyday. I feel his hands wrap around mine and I feel scared. I look over at him watching TV and a deep sadness wells up inside me. I'm so scared. He doesn't know what it's like to live in fear, to live like this. I'm always afraid that I will lose his love. Always been. They say that it's unhealthy, but it's the only feeling I know. 

We met shortly after I got discharged from the hospital. He gave me a reason to live. I love seeing his face everyday, sleeping next to him, waking up next to him, watching him play with the cat. Sometimes I don't even think about how much it hurts, because it makes me so happy. 

Yesterday the cat delivered some nasty scratches to my arm, and he washed them carefully with his handkerchief. I don't think I have ever experienced a love like this. But I'm so scared of losing it. It's been going well lately. We stayed home and watched Netflix all day last night. He made us dinner. I thanked him and kissed him on the lips. 

I think I have told him before that I would be dead young. It's not something I am consciously planning, but I won't say no if Death offered me a ticket. 

I love him too much, and I never want to lose him. That's why I must go before it happens. I want to go knowing that I am loved, before I lose everything. I love him too much, that's why I need to go.

When I listen to a certain song that conveys a melancholy emotion, I fantasize that I'm shot at the heart, killed in action. And I lay on the ground, my face lingered a remaining light, my youth is over. It's a beautiful way to die since I see this figuratively : my heart is too soft and big for this world, it had too much pain and being shot by a firearm symbolizes that it's excruciating than it ever was before. But then it's over.

And people I know, especially my loved ones had anguish in their faces that I never wish upon them. Loud cries feasting around. 

It seems like a beautiful way to die. As I take my last breath, I smiled weakly, my eyes losing its light, chanting something similar to Van Gogh's last words.

I don't really want to burden anyone else, but, well, I feel like Im sliding toward my grave and my fingernails are the only thing stopping me from falling in, and I need help. 

5 years ago my father passed away, and my life just started tumbling out of control. My Dad, despite his faults, was someone who loved me so very deeply, and I miss him so much. So, in deep depression I tried to take action to make it better, quitting my job and using my inheritance to go to mental health ""spa"" to try to get my mind together. Using a combination of exercise, diet and therapists I felt better than I had in years, and while there I met this beautiful, awesome girl and fell in love‚Ä¶ I then decided to move to New England, and we had so much fun together.

Unfortunately, since then, the relationship crumbled late last year, I havent found a job, I lost 2 close friends (1 to a heart attack, 1 who killed herself after I turned her down for a date), my car was repossessed and all of this was because I found myself in a crushing depression. I went home to my Moms house for a week, and she saw how depressed I was, and sent me to her therapist.

I came back to NE, and saw a therapist weekly, and starting about 2 months ago slowly started to climb out of depression, and from the looks of it my finally started getting better.  I had a great job interview, and believe I will get the job next week.

But, then things crashed.  I havent had any money for a few months, and I am now being kicked out of my apartment, I have no place to go, and since I am so close to being health and having a job, I called my Mom for emergency help, needing to only last one more month, and she not only said no, she told me not to contact her.

So, I am now only totally broke, have no idea where I am going to go Sunday, I have been vomiting from stress, unable to sleep, can barely eat, and the only thing that pops up in my mind is suicide. Bad things just keep happening, and depression is ruining my life. Just when I think Im escaping it, something smacks me down‚Ä¶ and I am so very tired.

I don't want this to be the rest of my life. I don't want to homeless. I am so ashamed.

My friends have distanced themselves, My sister calls me immature and tells me I need to grow up, my Mom wont talk to me, my brother has his own load to carry, and my therapist doesn't see past the surface.  Reddit, I cry all the time. I look at the tool I want to use to kill myself, and know that it would only be uncomfortable for like a minute, and then nothing would hurt ever again. I know suicide would hurt everyone around me, but how long can I last feeling like this.. Im just so tired.

I even went into a church today ,and begged God for help. Nobody answered so far.

I just want to crawl into a pile of love and heal for a month, I need love.. Im so alone,  but there isn't anyone out there who is loving me.. whats wrong with me? 

Im sorry for rambling, I just.. I don't know what to do anymore, and don't want to burden anymore people with my sadness, or my life. I just seem to let people down all the time.

Now my gf left because of something horrible I  said. Before I met her, I'm at the verge of depression but now I've fallen off the cliff and hard. I know that she's not the only significant part of my life but because of it, I've lost focus in everything.  I've lost interest in everything. When it continues to be like this, I'll lose my job and I'll flunk college and this time, it will be final. I'll be a real piece of shit and great big disappointment to people who have big expectations  from me.

The feeling that I hate the most is regret. Now it's overwhelming me. The only thing that's keeping me from doing it is the thought of my friend seeing me dead; my parents crying and all their efforts on me wasted. I'll die a disppointment. There's still a tiny amount of  hope that she'll forgive me, but if that hope vanishes, and the pain becomes unendurable, I know I'll be able to do it.

236089,"Just wanna talk with someone right nowHi, I don't really know what to do. This pandemic is really taking a toll on my mental health. I know my friends are supportive, but I just don't know how to tell them that I need help and support. I know everyone's dealing with a lot of things now like I do so I don't wanna bother them. I just want to talk with someone right now, or maybe at least get everything out from my system by writing it here. I do talk with my friends sometimes, but I really can't tell them exactly what's going on in my mind right now. I've been trying to talk to my SO too, but I don't know, he seems not to care, and that hurts me, big time. I know he has problems too, and I'm not asking too much from him either, but I really do feel that he doesn't care about me. 

So yeah, I really don't know what to do. I feel like being quarantined in our house is really suffocating. I mean, don't get me wrong, nothing's wrong with my family, I love them, and it's just me that has problems. I can't seem to stop thinking about my childhood traumas, like, yeah, I get it, it all happened in the past, but I just can't let it go. You see, I was physically abused as a child. I mean, it's normal here in our place to beat up a child when that child ""did"" something wrong as a way of teaching them discipline, but come on, just because it's ""normal"" or many people are doing it, doesn't mean it's right. So yeah, that's where I'm coming from; although that happened ages ago, and it's no longer happening now. 

But yeah, I'm still traumatized by those events, and I can really notice that I'm the one who's being toxic in this house. I get irritated or angry easily here, although I'm not like that outside, or when I'm with other people, because I'm not really like that, but I'm somehow easily triggered when I'm around them or when I'm in the house. I don't know why I'm being like this, but sometimes, I feel like I deserve an apology from them, specially from my mother why I became like this. As selfish as it sounds, but that's how I really feel and I just wanna get this off my chest. Like, how can they be okay while I'm not? I don't want to be angry, but I just can't stop, it's not that easy, but it's also hurting me, because I also love my mom, more than I can actually imagine. I'm also angry at myself, for being angry at my mom. And it hurts me so much that I just want to kill myself already, but I can't, because first of all, I don't have the guts to do that, although I tried it before, but I got scared, and lastly, I know deep in my heart that  I don't really want to die. What I want is to just forget everything. Well, I gotta admit, there are times when I really wanna do it, like I really wanna die, but I can't, because I know that'll hurt my mom so bad, and I don't want that to happen. So yeah, I don't really know what to feel. I feel so worthless, lost, scared, etc, idk.

I can't tell this to anyone, not even my closest friends, not even my SO. Although I really want to talk with them about this. I just wanna get this off my chest, I guess, or talk with someone to distract myself from these thoughts. I've been trying my hardest to distract myself, but nothing seems to be helping. I tried watching series, reading comics, playing games, listening to music, but yeah, I still feel like shit.

I spent the whole holiday looking at things feeling dull and miserable and thinking 'wow, this'll be the last time I see this'. But I never did it, I chickened out cause I'm just more afraid of the nothingness and pain of dying than I am of continuing to live. Which sucks. I can't commit to anything. Now I'm here still alive going through the same shitty season again. 

I'm doing marginally better, I guess, but still think about killing myself fairly often. I look back at what I've done over the past year and though I've done some good stuff I don't... care about any of it. Nothing justifies being grateful that I'm still alive, cause I'm not, I still hate being myself. Nothing changed that. I finished an entire fall semester without flunking out of it for the first time in 3 years, and I'm proud of that, but I still feel meh more often than not. I'm still scared of everything. I'm still paranoid, still afraid of the future, still cringing every couple of hours at all the horrible stuff I've done in the past. I'm not *as* passionless as I used to be, which is good. Still not really wanting to be alive though, just too scared to commit to anything, including my own death. Or maybe I don't want to die at all and I'm just being melodramatic cause it's easier than working on myself. Probably that one.

I'm terrifying of going home in two days for Christmas because being around my parents is hell. They're not bad people or parents or anything like that, they do nothing wrong, but I still dread being around them. It's exhausting smiling for that long around my dad, watching and policing everything I say. He has an insane instinctive talent for knowing exactly what anyone around him is insecure about and bringing it to the forefront of conversation as a joke. It's as impressive as it is miserable. I doubt he knows what he's doing, and it isn't all the time, but still. It can be debilitating. My mom terrifies me, I hate listening to her talk. She scares me so so so much just by talking about herself; she makes me feel like I'm drowning and there's no way out, that everything is hopeless, that the world is hopeless that my life is hopeless and there's nothing I could ever do about it because it's ingrained into my bones. They're both hell. 

The only thing I miss about home are my brothers, but we've grown so far apart that I'm pretty sure whatever relationships we did have are down to nothing. I'm an outsider to them, which is fine. It makes it easier when I eventually croak it- and they're happy, I can tell they're happy, and that makes me so so happy for them. They're okay, they're going to be okay. Having to live awkwardly in the house for the next couple of weeks around them when I'm so out of place is going to suck a little though. 

I don't even like Christmas, the whole season fucking sucks. There's a voice in my head that reminds me that I've still got time to make last year my last Christmas, but I'm not going to off it. I already said I'd go home, and I can't kill myself while I'm there. So here's to another shirty fucking holiday, sometimes I think itd be nice to die in my sleep.",suicide

I've heard from a few people that the types that actually kill themselves are the people that don't say they are, not the ones that talk about it.

I've not been diagnosed with anything, but I know from research and family history that I suffer from bouts of depression and bi-polar disorder.

Some back story on why I frequently think about doing it:
My girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me recently and started dating her ex, who I found out was never really out of the picture.  I have a job at a decent company, but it prevents me from going back to school and attaining a degree, thus keeping me from moving up in my job.  My daily job activities are dull and I don't like what I'm doing, but I love the company and it's benefits. I'm in a lot of debt.  I don't have spending money, it all goes to bills.  My car got messed up recently and I don't have money to fix that.  I feel like my friends aren't good enough friends for me to ever mention this to or that they would be supportive if I did.  I don't have the gumption to try and meet new people.

My home life (I'm still with my parents because of my money issue) isn't great.  My dad suffers from bi-polar disorder but refuses to accept the fact and can become verbally abusive to my mother and brother.  My brother suffers from it, but takes medication for it, so it's not so bad.  My mom seems to be at the end of her rope with all of the problems in her life.

183982,"Struggling even more, truly can‚Äôt see how it can ever get better.I posted a couple of months ago about feeling suicidal after my mom‚Äôs death. It‚Äôs been 4 months today since she passed, and I feel worse than ever. Every day I wake up and wish I was dead and hope today is the day I get to go. I talk to my mom every day and beg her to come get me, just let me go, let me be with her, etc. Maybe that sounds stupid, but I think if she has anything to do with it from her side now, she wouldn‚Äôt let me die. But then I think that if I‚Äôm not going to die naturally anytime soon, I could just do it myself and go now and not have to wait. The grief is just swallowing me whole. I hate being alone anymore because the loneliness of not having my mom just sends me spiraling into an emotional breakdown. Even just being alone driving to the store is long enough to kick the grief into full force. I can‚Äôt distract myself, although I‚Äôve tried really hard to find something to keep my mind busy enough, started new hobbies and everything. 

I went to therapy for a couple of months, but as soon as I could manage not crying during an appointment, the counselor said I was getting better and started cutting my appointments down. The truth was that I could make it through the appointment but then went to my car and cried. I told her I didn‚Äôt think what I was doing with her was helping, as pretty much her only advice was to keep myself busy, and she said she didn‚Äôt think I ‚Äúeven wanted to get better.‚Äù That was the last time I went, about a month ago I guess. I‚Äôm open to another counselor and have even been searching online for someone locally who may be a good fit, but my problem is that I can‚Äôt see how things can ever get better when the only thing that could make it better is to have my mom back, and obviously that‚Äôs never going to happen until I get to die and be with her on the other side. 

I‚Äôm just so tired. It‚Äôs only been four months, but that‚Äôs four months too long. I‚Äôm so tired of feeling so sad and lonely and depressed that I would rather be dead. After she died, my desire to marry and have kids has all but disappeared because I can‚Äôt do it without her. Those are the only two things that even seem like they might be worth living for, but if I can‚Äôt even do them anymore without her, what‚Äôs left? I have a wonderful partner who I love deeply, so I feel really guilty about feeling like I‚Äôd rather leave than stick around for him. The only time I feel even remotely decent is when I‚Äôm with him, but I can‚Äôt be with him every minute, and I feel like it‚Äôs unfair to put that responsibility of always trying to make sure I‚Äôm alright and spending all his time with me when he deserves to have his own space and time too. We‚Äôve always talked about having kids, but on top of the fact that I don‚Äôt even know that I could be a good mom anymore, once I have kids who depend on me, I know I have to stick around for them and honestly I feel like I want to option to die without worrying about leaving kids behind and putting them through what I‚Äôm going through. 

I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm hoping for in response, but I just needed to put it out there, I guess. I‚Äôve been honest, especially in the beginning, about wanting to die with people in my life. They don‚Äôt know what to say. At most they say ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt because I couldn‚Äôt live without you,‚Äù but I can‚Äôt live without my mom, so why is it more fair that I have to live with this pain every day than if they had to live with me being gone? I don‚Äôt know. I guess I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has any perspective on how to deal with wanting to die when the reason you want to die will never resolve or get better or go away? If it was just a bad situation in my life or a bad relationship or something that could be temporary or resolved, I could pull myself out of it eventually. But my mom is gone forever, so I can‚Äôt see how it can ever get better. I can‚Äôt get to a point where I can ‚Äúlive for her and make her proud‚Äù or ‚Äúbe happy because that‚Äôs what she would have wanted‚Äù or whatever else everyone says in situations like this. I‚Äôm just scared and lost without her and wish it would just end already.",suicide

56512,"The mask we wearI attempted suicide a month ago. I've been inpatient, partial inpatient, and now intensive outpatient (supposedly I'm bipolar type 2/severe depression). I have talked about ""wearing a mask"" every single day at work (while I'm in therapy). I put on my bright smile for my patients and my coworkers. No one knew what was coming.

The ""mask"" is what we ""wear"" everyday to get through the day and make everyone think we're okay, even though we aren't. We don't want people to worry, or we don't know how to ask for help, or maybe we think they don't want to hear about it.

The mask is how we hide our shame of being depressed.

I feel like my mask has shattered, and I have been laid bare. I can't gather the strength for a smile anymore for anyone. My days bleed together. I feel like therapy isn't working, or maybe the medications they put me on aren't working. I know I have an amazing support system, but getting through the day is just a hassle. Once I get home from therapy (it's 3 days a week for 3 hours now that I'm intensive outpatient), I lay down and turn on YouTube to watch other people play video games, because I can't even muster the energy to play a video game myself. Than I stay in bed the rest of the day. If I think about it, I might eat something. I'm down to maybe one meal a day. 

I drastically changed my hair the other day. I bleached it, than dyed it 4 different colors. I've been thinking about just packing a bag and disappearing, maybe going to the Appalachian trail and just walking. I don't care what happens to me.

I have been contemplating suicide again. I've been gathering information about where I went wrong last time. I've even told my therapist what I was doing, how I was gathering information so I didn't mess it up next time. She only asked me if I had a plan, which I told her I did not, and it was only thoughts at the time. I don't know what I'm asking for here. I just need to put it out there.

188185,"I am a 28-year-old with avoidant personality disorder. I plan to end my life on Friday, October 5.Hi, 

A lot of you have probably heard of social anxiety disorder. I have basically a much more severe version of it wherein my whole existence is based upon my avoidance of intimidating social situations out of a fear of rejection. This will be the illness that kills me. 

I behave like the most introverted man on the planet, often coming across as aloof or uninterested. I'm 28, and most of the people who I've lived near my whole life don't even know me, nor have I even spoken with many of them. Yet underneath that veil of severe avoidance I have an intense desire for friendships and intimate relationships. 

I built a living for myself working as a freelance writer online with the sole purpose of undertaking an occupation that limits my time with people as much as possible even though I really would like to be around people. It's just that I can't face the potential for rejection or embarrassment. 

I am desperately lonely and sad in life. I can't stop berating myself over how I spent much of my 20s, particularly the last 3-4 years, which have been spent probably 70-80% in isolation. The weight of guilt for not making friends and spending so much time alone is enormous. 

Out of an attempt to provide balance, I've done some objectively cool/interesting things that normal people do, such as traveled alone to Thailand 10 times, took a Thai cooking class while over there, went hiking in northern Thailand, visited Vietnam, taught myself acoustic guitar, had two girlfriends, started my own Thai food website, and finished a degree. But still, many of those experiences were ruined by my avoidance, or they just fed into my avoidance. 

I tried group therapy recently but the bus was late for today's session and I couldn't face the potential embarrassment of walking in the door 30 minutes late while everyone was already settled. The first session was very intimidating but I managed to show up last week, however, missing today's session means I'm back to square one. 

The sessions run every Thursday. If I know myself like I do, I'll come up with some shitty excuse to avoid the 3rd one next week. If i avoid it, I plan to end my life. Because there's just no hope for me if I continue to live life based on avoiding things. Anyway, thanks for reading and thanks for any advice. ",suicide

I‚Äôm not sure why I am making this post but mainly it is to say that it is possible to reach 20, for the longest time I didn‚Äôt think I would see 14 or 16 or 18 let alone 20. I did not think I would make these milestones, being diagnosed depressed at 12 and feeling suicidal for the most part of my teen years I never thought I would outlive being a teen and yet here I am. 
For the most part I am happy. 
I have made it this far and I have learnt a lot, I have lost people so dear to me and I have gained a few people I will never forget. 

I‚Äôm going to tell my story and explain why it is important to keep going even if it feels impossible. 
At home I had a rocky life with my stepdad being in and out and loosing all connection with my real dad which was a mind boggling struggle I have now accepted. 
My school life was no easier, at 13 I was sat down and was told I wasn‚Äôt welcome in my friend group. I was devastated but realise this has taught me not everyone has your best interest at heart. 
At 14 I came out as bisexual and was scared to admit and face it to my peers.
At 15 I lost my girl friends because I couldn‚Äôt cope with the negativity they brought and chose to leave, this taught me it‚Äôs okay to loose people for your best interest and to be selfish.

At 16 I made the best friends I have had. I had the most wild year of living, the childhood I missed out; playing in the woods, trying new things, having sleepovers and walking for miles, it really was my best year. Then suddenly I lost one of them (to suicide) and really mourned that, understanding that it would easily have been me and seeing the repercussions and realising the effect it had. 
From 16-18 I was in a relationship which I cannot sum up into words but thought would be never ending as I loved hard and gave my absolute everything. To realise it wasn‚Äôt meant to be and was harmful. I never thought I would overcome that but now am in a stable relationship.

I went through moving schools and collages, gaining friends and loosing them to experiencing some of the worst traumas (sexual assault) a person aged 60 hasn‚Äôt gone through. I have lived wildly and beautifully, sometimes tragically and painfully for 20 years. 

I want every teenager to know that it will get better. There will be a time that you leave home and escape abuse or poverty, you will grow and succeed and sometimes fail and that is okay. 
You will find friends or loose friends (I have no friends) and it‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs better to have no company than bad company. 
You will flourish and fail and that‚Äôs normal, no one has any idea what they are doing so keep going with no plan, a good plan, or a failure of a plan.

My life is not good but it‚Äôs better than it was. It‚Äôs a few hours since I turned 20 and I still know nothing but I promise 14 year old you will survive this and you will learn and grow and loose and fight and it will be okay. 
I am terrified of my 20‚Äôs but I am grateful to have had my teen years. 

Please reach out if you need help, to me or a teacher or anyone.

I've successfully conditioned myself to believe I deserve literally fucking nothing good in my life, and every time I do anything that makes me comfortable my body starts ringing alarm bells to remind me I don't deserve to forget how much of a waste of flesh I am.

Everything's my fault, you know? It's not even something I say for pity anymore. I can't justifiably find a way to convince myself something might not be my fault, because as long as I'm in any way involved, I can be blamed for it in one way or another. If someone hurts me and I tell them, they'll feel guilty. They'll blame me for hurting them like that, eventually. It's my fault. It's my fault, and I deserve every bit of pain I'm in.

But I'm tired. I'm so, so, so incredibly tired and even though I know the only way for the people around me to be happy is for me to suffer in silence, I'm still tired. I need to die. That's the only way things can ever be okay for any of us; me, or my friends.

It's always been hard but at some point you realize it's always going to pass. It's always going to get easier with time because time will heal all wounds; but if my existence in itself is the issue, that's an entirely different thing altogether. I can't separate from myself. Time won't make me not exist.

248227,"I found some reasons to live. Might cancel my suicide date.19/M


1- I've sent messages to my mom about my suicidal thoughts. He talked with me so good that I actually felt sad because she loves me so much , she took care of me so much when I was a kid, If I suicide she would be destroyed. Yes there are so many times where she talks bad with me but deep in her heart she loves me and cares about me more than anyone on this world. 

2- Yeah life sucks but I started to set mini goals and decided to get a cold shower and shave. Cleaning my room, working on the house a bit . I feel so much better , I just need some time to think about my future and the things I can do to enjoy life.

3- I always had mixed thoughts about my sexuality. I'm kinda bisexual. I tend to feel happier if I were to choose my sexuality without fear and anxiety. But my religious beliefs on christianity has destroyed me . I lost my confidence and became shy about my sexuality. I can't even be myself anymore because I feel guilty and depressed. I don't know what I can do to fix this... 

4- I might start to working out in order to lose some weight. Since I became religious I gained couple pounds due to binge eating . I've been depressed due to religious trauma so I've been eating to feel happy. Got a bit fat on my belly area. This made me feel even worse. Maybe if I just start working out and lose some couple pounds I might start to feel fresh and chill again ....

5- I failed most of my exams on the first year of college. Again , due to my religious beliefs i wasn't too focused on my normal life. I can either give up and end it or try again to work on my grades. 

So yeah these are the things rn that I've keep looking into. I might fix myself up, start working out, trying another year on college, try to be more open about my sexuality etc. It's better than giving up I guess..",suicide

278768,"I'm transgendered but not transitioning to male; recently became obsessed with male singer and going insane of the epitome of what I wish I was and what I can't doI made a new account because I feel like I'm actually going insane, to the extent where I haven't expressed to anyone I know personally why I have been so depressed the past two weeks. I'm a 17 year old girl, and I've known for the past two years that I would be much happier and more content in a male body and life. However, I have eliminated transitioning as an option so I just have to be miserable with what I am. Recently, I discovered a singer/songwriter who seems to be the most talented human being. He has been playing guitar and singing and doing other instruments since he was young, like middle school, and his music is easily the best I've ever heard by far. He has such a simply interesting style and the most beautiful voice. I wish I could be him, be that. 

Since discovering more of his music recently and his new album, I feel like I've gone fucking insane. At this moment I have slept in 38/39 hours because every time I stop distracting my mind I end up crying or in a panic attack. I feel like I've wasted my entire life in a miserable existence that I don't want. I want to be able to make such lovely music, but anything I try to write is shit and I feel like it's too late to actually devote myself to a music career and learning guitar (or anything else). I feel so useless and talentless and like a piece of shit. I have always been focused on getting really good grades, but now that I'm 17 and trying to think of what I am actually going to do with my life, I feel so vapid. His lyrics are so painfully good and I can't even come close. I try to comfort myself with the thought that other artists vary from him and are still successful, but I have this insane feeling of being cheated out of a life like his (I was cheated from being male, cheated from having talent by parents who never wanted me to learn anything). Also, my mom died when I was 15 so I'm even more alone.

Beyond just the realm of possibility that maybe I can become more ""masculine"" and learn some instruments, it feels too late and I'll never have the voice. I'm 17, and it seems like all good artists have such early starts and I know nothing. Additionally, I have female vocal chords. I want that deep gritty man voice that breaks and sounds raw, I sound like a fucking stupidly flat, smooth child. It makes me want to kill myself, because I will never be able to be what I want or do what I want now that I've found such an aching desire.

I feel so hollow and alone. I wish I could have just been born a man with talent and the ability to learn an instrument. I've devoted my life to shit that means nothing and now it's too late. I can't sleep and I barely eat. I know I'm putting a stranger on a pedestal but I would sacrifice anything to be him. I hate my own life so much. I think about the peace of suicide and just letting go of the things I can't change, and maybe in some edition of some form of heaven I can be who I want to be. I'm not even religious, I just need to believe that in some dimension I am who I wish I was. I hate myself. I hate myself. I feel so alone.",suicide

77402,"Right now, I am on a weird situation.Well, I'm a long spectator on this subreddit and I never thought I would post something here, but anyway.


Well, I don't feel much explaining too much, but there's something on my head that is bothering me for a while now. Well, I've read a few threads which mentioned about writing a Suicide Letter with no intent of suicide.


Well, I've been thinking doing this, I do ""overthink a lot"" and I wanted to have a way to express all my emotions on a paper, maybe releasing these emotions could help me stop thinking on so much crap.


The problem is, whenever I feel the need of suicide, I always think on making a Suicide Note first. So there's some positive and negative things that could happen if I ever wrote that piece of paper.


The positive is, I would probably stop thinking on what I think pretty much everyday, and maybe would be able to concentrate on the good things of life.


The negative is, if there's any bad day, situation, moment, whatever, or if I end up remembering about those thoughts, I'm just one step closer to attempt suicide, since I have the Suicide Note written and completed, and I have no ""self-obligation"" to write a note first since it's already done.


I have depression for probably more than 7 years now, and I've had suicidal thoughts through the years, got into two therapies and now I'm on the third one. Thankfully, I never tried committing suicide ever, and I also never self-harmed in any way.


Though, I'll wait, I hope I don't have a need to write this note anytime soon. If things go right, my life may change it soon, I hope, I'm visiting a third therapy which is a lot different than the first two I've been (the first two I was were when I was a bit more younger), and currently has been going well.


My age is above 18 and less than 30, sorry, I feel insecure telling my actual age due to some reasons.


I'll start doing a drawing course soon, I always wanted to draw but I always felt unmotivated due to my depression.


Also, just wanted to say: I found this subreddit (and r/depression a while later) middle of the last year, that was when I got my latest depression, and I need to say that this community is great, people are incredibly loved here and everyone's trying to support everyone.

basically, i asked him to hang out with me. his mum said no, and later that night, threatened to take him out of the school because of me wanting him to come out with me

hes a very over protected child, too. he doesn't smoke, drink, or do drugs, unlike most people at my school (its a very small school for autistic people, stoners, and dropouts)

so today, me and my other stoner friends invited him out with us, and we were gonna leave at lunch time. we begged his mum to go, and she still said no

now, another thing is, one of the methheads at my school, who is the ex bf of one of my best friends, is harassing everyone in the school, especially kids who know nothing about his drama thats going on rn

he harassed my baby alex this morning, and i was worried he was gonna do it again, so i wanted to take alex, especially because if we all left, he'd have NO protection from psycho bitchface

but me and my stoner friends left and said we'd come back to speak to alexs mum in person to see if he could come out. but a few hours later, alex called us, screaming and crying

apparently his mum said she'd take him out of the school, said that alex was a bad child (he really fucking isnt, and shes super lucky she had him as a child instead of ME or ANYONE ELSE IN MY ENTIRE SCHOOL), and misgendered my poor boy constantly

so now, i honestly wanna bash the shit outta his saggy tit 70yo looking plastic mother. ive been crying for most of the night since i got home, thinking about how hes probably gonna get hurt by his mum and how he might get taken out

after that, we haven't heard from him, and im worried asf about it

another thing, unrelated to alex: after we left school, we tried to accumulate $30 to get a bag of weed. it was pretty easy, and me and 3 others left to go to our beloved SeshBush‚Ñ¢

one of them walks up to their dealers house, which lives around there. she gets the weed, and comes back. she starts going off about how its underweighed, and that the bag was only worth $15 when we paid for $30

126693,"Falling apart, I feel like at this point, for me, it's euthanasiathrowaway, I've never posted here before. I read the rules though.   
I hope this doesn't get seen as a praising suicide post. This is about me and my medical problems.   
So I was thinking about how we put down animals as it is the humane thing to do when suffering. As I understand it, euthanasia is seen as an absolute last resort for someone when other medical treatment fails them. I've seen the argument that euthanasia for depression is wrong because there are many other ways to treat it.  


My problem is that all the treatments have failed me. I've seen a psychologist weekly for the last 7 years. I have a psychiatrist, and I've tried literally every available medication. They've done all the DNA tests that are supposed to help find what meds are more compatible, and I have traveled out of state to specialists. It's treatment resistant. My meds stop working after 6 months basically. And it seems like with everything I try, it helps for a little bit, but just stops, and the period of time that it helps feels increasingly shorter. I have done TMS treatment, but it didn't help at all. They want me to do ECT, but I know people who had horrible times with it, who suffered permanent memory loss or other cognitive functions. If I did that, there's a chance I would lose what makes me myself.  


I don't know what to do though. Like I have severe depression, horrible OCD, crippling anxiety and agorophobia that doesn't let me leave my house (treatments for that have failed as well) autisim, and a physical disability that doesn't let me move my hands the way I want. I am living off of government disability money. I am 21 and living with my mom, stepdad, and stepsiblings. Honestly it's miserable being around the family members who are not my mom, they're just mean. But I feel like a burden. And I don't really have a future. I can't go to college and I can't function enough to have a job. I will never be independent. I will be relying on my mom for the rest of my life. Of course me killing myself would destroy her. The one thing I have going for me is that she loves me. She takes care of me, brings me to all of my appointments, manages my medications and finances, and basically without her I wouldn't be here typing any of this. I am incapable of feeling nonplatonic feelings, and I don't have the emotionally capacity or energy for any kind of romantic relationship, so she's really all I will ever have.  


But my life is still miserable. I'm so lonely, but I'm so socially awkward and have severe panic attacks, and my depression doesn't give me much mental energy for communicating. The best part of my day is when I'm asleep. My dreams sometimes are mundane, sometimes they're fantasies, and sometimes they are nightmares. But I would prefer nightmares that let me forget about this shitty life than anything more realistic. I constantly feel like crying, but tears don't form for me when I am sad. Nothing is enjoyable. I can't concentrate on anything. I haven't felt even slightly happy in years. It's not a rollercoaster, it's just a deep pit. Every day I think about ending it. Sometimes it feels like my body is craving self harm. I don't do it because I don't want to get caught, but I constantly have intrusive thoughts about wanting to cut my wrists.   


My therapist knows I am depressed, but I can't talk to her about self harm or suicide. I'm too scared of being committed. I was in a psychiatric hospital before as a teenager, and they mistreated and abused me. It caused me to not trust people for a long time. Every time I ever tried to talk about it or go into detail, I started shaking and crying involuntarily. I have so much trauma from it, and I would rather die than risk being sent to one again.   
I just crave some kind of release. What I am doing really isn't living. I am only alive because it would destroy my mother if I died. She would never be the same. That's really my only reason for living, to make my mom not devastated.  But with no treatment that works, and not being able to function enough to have any kind of future, is this even living?   


I have tried every avenue of treatment and therapy available, and it just doesn't work. I don't function to the point where some days I cant even get out of bed. I fantasize about somehow getting drugs and killing myself through an OD, because I think that would not devastate my mom as much as a straight up suicide. I'm not gonna do it though. I can't. I wish we lived in a world more understanding. Where they would think of me being completely treatment resistant similarly to someone with a physical ailment that isn't curable and causes them pain too. I feel guilty, but I often wish I had cancer or something else that would let me die in a way that would be easier for my mother to accept.   


I don't know, I just had to type this and put it somewhere. I need some kind of help, encouragement or just that someone read and listened to my thoughts.   


The way things are going, I think I'm just going to continue this existence of barely functioning to not hurt my mom. But I feel so close to the edge sometimes, and I worry that something could come up and push me off, metaphorically. I dont know if im allowed to ask for specific advice, but I really would like to be able to get a handle on these intrusive thoughts, espeically the ones where I crave self harm to my body.

44109,"I've lost the one person who meant everything to me. I can't feel anything anymore.Over the last two weeks, I've felt like the most pointless existence in the world. My best friend, who I trusted and cared about, who saw me at my most void and vulnerable times, who helped me through that, has been brushing me off and making it abundantly clear he doesn't want my company and/or friendship. At first it hit me really hard and then for the few days that followed, it fell off my shoulder like it was nothing big. That week I barely felt anything at all. 

Tonight I had the chance to fix whatever happened with my friend and I up, but I missed it. My friend is in a band, and in the past I've gone to every show and gig they've done. My friend loved it when I supported him. They had one on tonight, but I found out about it too late and it clashed with a work shift, therefore I couldn't go. 

I feel like I've let my friend down. I wanted so badly to go because I love supporting him. I want him to know that I still value his presence in my life even if he doesn't do the same. I feel like maybe he thinks I'm also uninterested in salvaging the friendship because I didn't go. 

His band has a gig next week, and I plan to go to that. But I'm scared about what I'll say to him tomorrow, and at the same time, a part of me just does not care and wants me to feel nothing and move on. 

Why is this my life? Why can't I keep the one person who meant the world to me close by? Why do I drive everyone away? I want to die and get this all done with. ",suicide

Well, I'm not anymore. I fucked it all up. Granted, it was a crappy semester and I have 5 semesters left. I can always get better, things won't always suck so bad, and sure, I can make the positive impact on people that I always wanted. But living with that shame is hard. It burns on the inside. 

Ironically, all I do now is spend a lot of time on reddit. I think it keeps me distracted. But hours on end? At some point I'm going back to school, and what then? People will know how bad I fucked up, they'll lose respect for me, and so I become irrelevant. Because I never had anything else to offer to people except for what I could do, for the example I set, and therefore the help I could give people. Helping people is the only thing that kept me happy this past semester, and yet. Now if I help them, it all seems like it'll be under false pretenses. 

My freshmen that'd I'd tutor hold me in pretty high regard. They'd tell people I was some kind of genius (I'm really not), but the fact that they'd respect me so much made me happy and really compelled me to help people in the first place -- ""give back"", as you will. Now, I feel like a sham. I can't do that anymore. I am so worried that they are going to lose respect for me.

I need help. I don't talk to anyone anymore. I never considered suicide like I have now. I want it all to end, because even though fundamentally I know it wasn't that bad of a failure, it sorely failed to meet my own expectations.

319422,"Going to talk to Student Advocacy about a potentially fatal errora year and a half ago, I was checked by my campus police to see if I was suicidal, and whether they should take me to a hospital. I lived in a dorm there at the time, and I had to talk to eight different people in 24 hours about my safety. Finally I said, enough, I've just told eight different people that I'm safe, I'm not going to the campus center to talk to a crisis counselor.

Here's where the error STARTS. after what had occurred, my roommates didn't want to live with me anymore, so residential life services (this is now 48 hours afterward) sat me down and told me I was to move elsewhere and that after our meeting I needed to go and get stuff for the night. I was going to be moved into a one-bed little dorm room while they waited to find me a place in another apartment.

So, what they didn't realize was they dropped something pretty traumatic on me, a student who is still experiencing suicidal thoughts, and then said I was to be in a room all by myself. In other words, they handed me the PERFECT, and I mean PERFECT opportunity to kill myself, and I knew it. They were lucky I decided to go home instead. They were lucky that I had a home close enough to go to, because another suicidal student would be stuck in that one room. 

See the thing is, they were also lucky that I was not sure if I wanted to die, especially die that night. I knew that I was at serious risk if I went to the one room, and if I mentioned that risk I would be taken to the hospital, so I left it at that.  If I was more determined, you bet I would have taken that room. It would feel like a stroke of luck, in the twisted way my mind worked. For a good twenty seconds, it was.

I've waited a little too long to talk to a school official, and I'm only motivated to do it because they reached out to me to see if I was doing okay after an unrelated incident. It's been really distracting, I'm not going to lie. I want to get to my work that I have to do, but it feels like the beginning of a closing on that traumatic experience.",suicide

I thought I'd be over her after a month, but that came and I was as miserable as the day she changed her mind. 100 days came and I was still miserable. Five months passed, and I lost all my sanity. She claimed to be my friend but she showed me nothing of the sort. I put my trust in her and she told me that things were fine but she did nothing but lie and drag me along. Leaving me lost with nothing but my imagination. And I lost my sanity. I became obsessed because I couldn't understand how someone could lie to my face and put me through that torture.

Even now I'm 8 months away from when I first lost all joy and nothing is getting better. I WILL NOT LIVE A LIFE FILLED WITH NOTHING BUT THIS PAIN AND DARKNESS.

Recently realized im some level of LGBT soup.  Life looking better (overall). Finally denied help to see what else is going on. The darkness returns. ARGHHHH**  

Over 20 years ago I had issues. Lived in a high stress environment and never had time to tend to me. I was last priority. Have 2 attempts under my belt (1998 &amp; 1999). Was actively refused help, but my siblings were able to get help, as much in the world as they wanted. Boys after all have to toughen up, man up, build a bridge and get over it. Constantly bullied, constantly harassed, constantly victimized by those of power (family, school, parents, police, other ""adults""). I built a facade, toughened up, built a bridge and turned into a person capable of turning emotions on and off like its a switch. Made me plenty of enemies. I was incapable of emotion outside of existing. I couldn't die because that's what many wanted, and *told me so*.  

In the last decade or so, realized transgender was a thing. Doesn't matter parent wise as both are now dead, still only have a handful of friends (from the era above) that understand where I was but we don't talk much anymore. I cant die now, because I'm transgender ( *insertMentalText($buzzwords-&gt;$lgbt['keywords']);* ) and that only adds the icing on the cake for those who prefer me dead. Sweet (eat that you SoB's)...  

Now I've started to become a person. Oh shit, full emotions. That emotion switch is getting harder and harder to turn on and off. This is kind of cool... Nice... Finally, living not just existing for the sake of existing as a numb figure. Good big things on the horizon. Awesome. Also started to look into what some other issues I have going on. Doctors, appointments, long drives (because I live in middle of nowhere) All kinds of stuff scheduled. Things are looking up. Things are ""improving"". But, I've never had anything good without excessive cost and I didn't know what that cost was until last week and I'm not sure its even worth it anymore. My death panel called """"""""""""""""""""insurance"""""""""""""""""""" (that I'm required to buy, by law) has denied the rest of my tests an I'm sure as hell not getting any better. Once again, as usual I gotta fight for **everything** that's ever happened (bad, mediocre, ok, or even remotely good). I'm sick of fighting, my whole life has been a fight, even for the smallest victories.  

Its getting darker. That familiar darkness I've fought to overcome 20  years ago, that darkness I've succeeded in defeating is making its return, and as usual without help. I once again stand alone to fight my own darkness. Once again I've called of work because I'm sick, its probably the stress, I get sick a lot but at least my boss is a great person &amp; boss. Here I sit crying, an emotion I'm still not hugely familiar with.  

I'm not suicidal right now. I have too many people to piss off. But dammit, I'm tired, here is my scream of tired aggravation into the void.

9364,"I'm having suicidal thoughts, but don't want to diei‚Äôve been some having suicidal thoughts in the last few weeks. i don‚Äôt want to kill myself, and i don‚Äôt necessarily want to die. i'm having feelings of worthlessness, feeling alone (my best friend just moved to the other side of the world), and that I matter to no one. i just turned 30 in May, and i feel so unaccomplished.

Last October, I spent a weekend in the ER when I went in for suicidal thoughts. It was the scariest thing I had ever done, but I was officially diagnosed with depression and anxiety, began taking medication, and seeing a therapist.

Things were on the up &amp; up until recently. I had a job that was supposed to be for 3 months (working in TV), but it got cut short and the show went on hiatus. that was the end of april. i haven't been able to find another job. my mother supports me financially and i feel guilty for it. i live in LA and she's on the east coast. she struggles enough to make her own ends meet, and then she has to worry about me. she's beyond retirement age and still working because of me.

sleeping has been horrible for me lately. i go to bed around 4-5am, and wake up between 2-5pm. it makes the day go by faster when i have NOTHING to do.

the only reasons i won't kill myself is because i don't think i'm capable of physically harming myself, i don't want to do that to my mom, i don't want to leave my cats alone, and (the stupidest reason imo) i don't want to miss the newest season of big brother.

i've thought about going back to the ER, but that wasn't the best experience, being on suicide watch, having no privacy, and having guards staring at me 24/7.

i have an appointment with my therapist this weekend, but I don't want to tell her what I've been feeling. 

i'm also debating on whether or not to tell my mother. i didn't tell her about going to the ER in October, she found out from a friend and flew out to be with me. 

TL;DR, i feel alone, haven't expressed my thoughts &amp; feelings to anyone. i have reasons not to kill myself, but i feel like i have nothing to live for. ",suicide

_________________________
If your enemy is yourself, does that make you a coward?

If what happened in your past greatly affected who you are now, does that make you weak?

The earliest memory I have is when I first entered the pre-k. I was four years old and, for some reason, my parents enrolled me later than the rest. I was pretty shy at first, being in a new environment, a child trying to adjust. Then these two girls began to bully me. I even recall feeling really sad and annoyed, telling my teacher about them but I was brushed aside because those two girls were ""smart and good"" kids in her eyes.

My memory blanks out and I somehow became best friends with those girls by elementary school. Everything seems normal. I feel happy. My grandparents take care of me and my brother. My parents argue. My mom points a knife at my dad but my grandparents hold them back. I play in the front yard and a guy tries to lure me inside his car. I run back inside.

My grandpa walked to his job like he always did. My brother and I play and my grandpa laughs. He returns home...I see him collapse. My grandma cries for help. My parents are at work. My brother is crying too. We are all crying. I call my mom on the phone, I speak through my tears. 
Its the first time I feel scared.

My grandpa can no longer speak afterwards. I talk to him. I still love his smile. After a few months he dies. I hold his cold hand, I don't want him to go.

My grandma holds my hand, my brother stays beside me. I hear my parents' shouting escalate till my mom cries into my shoulder.

I still wish this wasn't my most vivid childhood memory....


By the sixth grade, my classmates treated me differently. I do admit that like all people who had to go through their awkward preteen years, I was a little more lost and confused than most. Add a bit of self-consciousness and newfound hormones without any proper guidance from adults and you got yourself a mix for disaster. The kids in my class bullied me in the form of talking behind my back, making weird rumors (i.e. That I was a witch cursing everyone, etc..) , and just plain treating me like the class ""outcast"". This is where the internet became my best friend, because my bff decided to bully me too. This is also where I first learned about suicide.

By high school, I tried to change for the better. My 9th grade self sought recovery in the form of fake smiles and conversation with everyone. I tried to forget my past and, even if it was all superficial, I found it better than being alone.  I almost made it until the tenth grade when an AP teacher and a Literature teacher treated me differently. 

My classmates were practically geniuses, they were more outspoken than I was too. Those two teachers constantly ignored me, gave me weird looks, they avoided me whenever I tried to ask them for help after class...I began to feel dumb and unwanted. If only I were different; smarter, more extroverted, more perfect. I started to compare myself to others. The cracks on my mask showed, and I could no longer smile. 

I became more introverted over time, drowning in my silence. I was a raging storm bottled up; my mind crashing thunder, my heart a dying ember. I was even more lost than before. 
I was even more alone. 

I entered a college I hated, in a country I felt isolated, with a major I've come to detest. It was even more overwhelming than before. I tried to speak out but my parents didn't support me, forced me to stay in what felt like a prison. I ended up in another class full of the smartest individuals. I ended up incredibly stressed. I felt like I was losing my mind. I was hospitalized several times for major stomach pains and other physical ailments. I wanted to die more than ever. I wanted a truck to hit me as I crossed the road, I wanted to jump off the roof of my school and my dorm, I cut myself, I tried to overdose, suffocation, hanging.... then I graduated with a bachelor's degree feeling empty and disgusting.

I had to take a professional exam afterwards, but I couldn't focus at all while studying for it. I didn't understand anything I learned from my degree. I didn't take the exam and ran away. I was terrified of failure. But what I felt going back to my hometown was far worse.

I flew back home, ending up feeling like a waste of space. Months of depression and suicidal tendencies. My parents forced me to get up and get a job. I did get one....

I was constantly harassed and bullied by my coworkers and supervisor. They never taught me anything, made me work the field immediately the first day. I would ask them questions since I had no orientation. They constantly berated me, constantly looked down on me for not knowing anything. I did not cry for months. 
I felt hollow. 

Then I had a nervous breakdown in the middle of the afternoon. A wave of angry customers, a mistake of asking help from a coworker who misplaced a file placing all the blame on me...I walked out to the bathroom, my body shaking, my insides feeling numb, my brain throbbing, my eyes burning. I cried so much that day, couldn't work anymore and had to go back home. I eventually quit, they weren't happy about it.

The workplace offered mental health support but, overtime, never followed through with the paperwork. 

My brother had a similar experience in his own workplace, but he was stronger. He stayed and pulled through.

I tried taking the professional exam again, after my parents found out I lied in the first place....I failed.

For over a year I just couldn't move. I wonder what's the point of my existence. I realize someone as lacking as me could easily be replaced. I ask God everyday to kill me and  give life to someone who deserves it better.  

My parents urging me to get a job, to even study something else. I try and once I get a job offer I get so angry and irritated. I lose all my senses and the world turns gray. I don't feel any happiness, even fleeting moments feel like nothing.

I want to start over again, but my worst enemy is myself. My brother and my parents tell me the same thing. They tell me to just get it over with. To just do something. My brother tells me he understands, tells me that I need to overcome this battle.

They don't realize this is constant. Not just a battle but a series of wars escalating in my mind. 

There are people who have it worse, yet they overcome their hardships.
So why can't I do the same?

Can anyone give me the answers? Is there a step-by-step process? A book or a show you all watched that I haven't encountered?

I know the only person who could save me is myself but I've been trying and trying and ""by myself"" hasn't worked out for me so far....

Honestly, I've been planning in my head repeatedly when and how I'd end my life but coincidentally, unexpected guests and events and all that kept happening so I'm somehow still here.....

I just hate how weak and cowardly I am and how I can't keep my shit together anymore and I just get so angry and depressed all the time especially with jobs and life and I got an interview tomorrow and I just....the last time I got a job interview I screwed it up because once I was there I felt completely unhappy. What if I screw it up again tomorrow?
I'm afraid I'll never be a proper person, that I'll always be like this. I'm thinking of just ending it since I can't even imagine a future for myself anymore.


TL;DR : Constantly ignored and bullied by people, tried to work it out on my own &amp; didn't work, mind keeps shifting to death....Any advice on how to fix everything?

He has substance abuse issues and our problems climaxed during an awful morning where I lost to keys to the car and he punched me several times while I was holding our baby, leaving massive bruises all over my back. He stopped, apoligized and I found the keys, he left for the store and I called the cops and even though I know I did right(?) I feel guilty and sick about it but I was so terrified of him in the moment. And because he violated his probation (several times, not just during this situation) he'll be back in prison for 2 and 1/2 years.

I'm so fucking lonely, my life already felt like a disaster before this. I might have to leave this house in December.

I don‚Äôt really want to have sex with them or kiss them, or even really talk to them or their characters but I just kinda notice them, and certain aspects of there bodies. Because of this I have loosely considered my self bi, And in the community I live in, there‚Äôs not really a whole coming out thing, it‚Äôs just oh okay your dating a girl now, cool. I have never dated anyone, and have never wanted to have sex with anyone, like I see the appeal of doing it, I just have never felt horny. A couple days ago my friend introduced me to snl and since then it has taken over my life, and Scarlet Johansen is in some of the skits, she also played Black widow in the mcu. Ever since I saw her in some skits (it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve seen a marvel movie) I have been obsessively searching images of her and watching crap talk shows just to look at her. I don‚Äôt want to have sex with her and maybe I just don‚Äôt get it because every time I try to puzzle this situation out, I try imagining a sex scene and I get hung up on me, an overweight, acne covered, tweenage girl who has never had her period, getting into bed with freaking black widow, and I just cringe because I don‚Äôt get how that could be a fulfilling relationship, and that‚Äôs the confusing thing because I‚Äôve gathered that being horny is the antithesis of wanting a fulfilling relationship so Idk.

I‚Äôm in my room crying right now about my circumstances, and trying to think of the positive things coming my way soon, but it‚Äôs so hard to think on that knowing the problems I‚Äôm dealing with right now.

I was injured in late February where I sustained an ankle fractures that required surgery to add a metal plate and 2 screws in it. I also fractured my pelvis in three places as well. My bf of one year broke up with me because I stopped being the girl he fell in love with. Shortly after a guy I used to get to know but I stopped and politely rejected him (waited 3 months for him but he asked for even more time which I said into) reached out again. 

Well the guy told me that after things didn‚Äôt work out for us he he spent a year and some months literally praying to God for my ill health, and that I would fracture a few bones, and that God would leave me barren (his words). Well I blocked him after he told me that. It‚Äôs July now, and his words still leave me shocked.


I‚Äôm really broken right now from my pain from my injuries, the quality of my life sucks, being hated so much that someone could wish me ill, and I‚Äôm alone in this world with no friends. My ex was my best friend but what we had is over now.

I have always wanted a year off and because of that I havent been very motivated to go to college and so I think if I did take a year off it may make my grades better.
So what do you think? Do you think I should go back to college and carry on or do you think I should have a year off (the year off has to be approved so it could take a few weeks to be able to start my year off)

Where do I begin. Why am I posting this in an account I use to troll people? Wont everyone want me to kill myself? The truth is, nobody really cares about me anymore. I'll talk to people on discord and stuff, but it's not real friendship, you know? Kist stuff I do to pass the time. God, where do I even begin? Ok, January 23rd 1992. I think. Kansas, usa. I cant even remember where I'm from at this point. Probably my brain trying to suppress the years of abuse. I was born in a family of religious freaks. Like, absolutely crazy. Went on about how god hates gays. I mean, I'm straight, but when I was in boy scouts, I would occasionally have sex with the other boys. Nothing serious though, probably just puberty in all seriousness. Anyway, my dad used to beat me. Hard. I was home schooled and had no friends. I was only allowed to go to church and scouts, that's it. I got jobs when I was a teenager, and luckily I was able to save up and move to Kansas city on my 18th birthday. I never spoke to my father again, didn't even go to his funeral. In fact, I got really high once and went back home to piss all over that sick fuckers grave. Call me a dickhead, but that man is the main reason I'm in my car with a fuckdamn gun to my head. Anyway, in Kansas I had a roommate in my shitty apartment. His name was itsaki or some Japanese name. He introduced me to a therapist. My father always used god to address my mental health issues, rather than a professional. I went to her and they referred me to a psych ward for consistently using self harm as a coping strategy. Was diagnosed with bipolar, PTSD and maladaptive daydreaming. I was stuck in my fantasies for half the day, as a coping strategy for years of psychological and physical torture. After my shitty experience in the ward, and the huge fucking bill, I decided McDonalds wasn't going to cut it. I started mugging people and also getting into hard drugs. The vulnerable, mostly. It was shit, and I deserve to die for me, but it paid the rent. It was there I met the live of my life, stephanie. My life began to change, and I started getting happier. We married and were together for years, and my mental health issues started to go. However, one night I took some meth my dealer Eduardo dumped on me. She caught me, and was so upset she filed for divorce. This was two years ago, and it absolutely destroyed me. I started going hard again, everything coming back to me but worse, losing all the friends I had and only having my shitty computer, samsung phone(which I'm making this on) and a couple grams of drugs. I was running out of money. This is when I turned to trolling. I have a few other accounts as well, but I'm posting in this one. However, this couldn't take away from everything this shitty life handed to me. So, I'm crying, in my car with a gun to my head. I'm going to shoot myself and nobody is going to stop me. I've been dealt a bad hand and can't live through this any longer. If there is a god, and I am going to help, I hope to see my father burn. Fuck you dad.

My life is basically a long big fuck up interwoven with the occasional glympse on something working out, but soon ended by the inevitable setback. I didn't finish school when I was 18, wasted a couple of years in social isolation, managed to pull me through 3 years of evening school to get my A-grade equivalent, or whatever you do have in the US and only needed 3 hospitalizations and prolonged stays in a psychiatric clinic to do so. Now i'm supposed to finish my 5th semester in university, but really, it's my 7th real one if you count the ones during which I was hospitalized, and my depression is at an all time high again. I cannot force myself to do anything anymore. I've skipped most finals, I barely see anyone ever and I just find no joy in absolutely anything. My last and only relationship, if you wanna call it that was 6 years ago now, and it's increasingly hard to bear the lack of intimacy and emotional warmth. I'm surrounded by 21 year olds who manage to do university just fine, while also having a life besides, while I have nothing. I've bought a rope a week or two ago and tied a nice noose.

332832,"I threw away the best part of my life, I don't want to be here for the restI am 52, by internet standards I am ancient. For most of my life I lived with active self-hatred. I wanted to kill myself in junior high, and when I got out of high school. I wish I had. Then I had a major surgery for something that I had ignored the symptoms of for years. After the surgery, because of pain and the shock of it, I suddenly had compassion for myself, at least for my younger self. I realized what a waste my life had been, what I could have had if I had just liked myself then. I thought I was fat and ugly. It wasn‚Äôt true then it is true now because of time and biology. I don‚Äôt want to die. I just don‚Äôt want to live with this grief, regret, and shame and despair; and the loneliness. Especially the loneliness. I wanted to do so many things in my life, and now it‚Äôs too late. I neglected my health, and gained weight. I have lost 125 pounds, and I still have about 160 to go. Now I have an ugly scar, not that it matters. I am hideous. I made a post on r/loseit several years ago, and someone suggested that I might as well kill myself. I wish I had back then. The future holds no joy for me. There is nothing to look forward to. It‚Äôs too late to have any sort of a career. I don‚Äôt find men my age attractive. They look like my grandpa to me. I just wanted to be young and have fun and wear pretty clothes. I could have done all those things. I thought I was fat and ugly then, but I wasn‚Äôt. I am now. I will never be attractive. Even if I lose weight I‚Äôll still have extra skin. And to suddenly become ‚Äúself-aware‚Äù, and I am right in the middle of menopause, the surgery I had make me start menopause suddenly. It is like being hit by a bus. Sometimes I want to die just so the hot flashes will stop. I would rather just it be over with. I just want to have never existed. I have neglected my education. I dropped out of school so many times. Sometimes it was because of depression and anxiety, sometimes I think it was just because I wanted someone to notice how miserable I was. I have never had a real relationship. That is what I regret the most. I realized how lonely I am. That‚Äôs when I actually think about doing something, just to make it stop. I sit at the computer and tell myself how stupid I. I could blame all this on bipolar disorder and anxiety, but I could muddle through dead-end, mind numbing jobs. I could do things that I thought other people expected me to do, just not anything for myself. Most of my life was just on autopilot. My life before seems like it happened to someone else. I am on three medications and nothing is helping. They say that my feelings are just the depression talking, but at what point is it not? My situation is still the same. I couldn‚Äôt have fucked my life up more it I had deliberately planned it out. It‚Äôs all just so fucking stupid. Oh, and just for an added kick in the teeth, last October I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I am doing all the things I am supposed to to fight the cancer while at the same time wishing I were gone. If that makes any sense. If any of this makes any sense.

289118,"What if they find out I'm faking it?I'm terrified of how I'm feeling.

A bit of a background:  I had gotten to a pretty dark place almost a year ago.  My wife (I'm in my early 40s) pleaded to me to get help, and I did. I went on meds which, at first, intensified my suicidal thoughts but the dosage was upped and I felt I was getting better. I also started with a therapist --I've been doing cognitive behavioral therapy with her and that seems to have helped.  In fact, you could say that I was on a total upswing...

... until now. I feel like I'm spiraling out of control with my feelings. Work was tolerable before but now it's not. (My manager got laid off a month ago and I don't get along with my replacement supervisor or team.) I feel like there's no future for me where I work, and I'm frightened of going back out into the rest of the world to get a new job to only suffer more rejection. Work wasn't the best, but at least it was safe. Now -- not so much anymore.

And I feel the days getting shorter. Daylight Saving Time ends this Sunday and the clocks fall back - meaning it gets darker an hour earlier.  And it causes anxiety when I look at my day and see how little I've accomplished before the sun sets.  I don't know how I'll cope.

The worst thing? I volunteer with a youth group. Have been for a while. The kids are great and they've looked up to me.  I've been an adult they can talk to who isn't a parent and who won't be judgmental. Some of them have gone through some tough times and have confided in me because I've been a constant who can help them.

And I feel so fake because I try to help them see the big picture -- that everything will be okay. That there is hope. That they have their lives ahead of them to make good choices and thrive.  And they believe me. Yet I'm feeling no hope and no future for me.

What if they find out that I'm faking it?

I finally met a man who is far greater than any other man I've been with. His name is L. He is a hard worker with big goals, great integrity, and great patience. L has stuck by me through a lot of shit. We've only been together 2 months and he has loved me enough to stay with my through my suicide attempt, fits of rage, bouts of self harm, and many other things. I'm trying so hard to be a better person. I'm finally learning how to love myself when most of my life I've hated myself. I'm trying to get control over my BPD and be the best version of myself. I'm trying so hard to live and be happy and make him happy. He introduced me to his best friend, T, who has become a brother to me. T has my back through thick and thin. He sees me as more of a sister than his actual sister, and me being an only child, I see him as the brother I never had. 

L has been patient, more patient than anyone I've ever known, but I feel like I'm running out of chances with him. He hasn't explicitly said so, but I just feel it. The worst thing is that while my intuition is active and has served me in the past, I know I can't always trust it because of my mental health issues. All I know is I'm scared. If I lose L, I lose everything. I won't be stable enough to continue school (which thus far I've gotten all As), I'll lose my brother T, I'll lose my sanity, and I don't think I can survive another heart break. Especially since this man is significantly better than the last two men who broke my heart. I mean I don't blame people for leaving me, since it's hard to deal with someone with a mental illness like me. But if I lose L, I don't know if I can survive. 

I can buy a gun. I can find someone to buy barbiturates off of in the city. I know how to make a noose. If I get drunk enough I might be brave enough to slice my wrists open. I'm gonna do my best to be strong enough to live on alone. I'm gonna do my best to not kill myself. I really am. But I just don't think I can handle any more pain.

82722,"I think I‚Äôm coming to terms with letting go of life. It feels somewhat peaceful.My whole world changed last week and I‚Äôve been feeling very suicidal. I‚Äôve felt like this in the past, but it was more romanticising with the idea of death, and I could never really settle on how I wanted to go. The idea of going through with it terrified me and I always tried to take my mind off it. There was a night that I was taking drugs at a party, and I never had the intention to end it that way, but I also didn‚Äôt really care about if I did, so I just kept on taking more and more. I apparently blacked out once that night. Didn‚Äôt care when I was told about it... But one day part of me thought fuck, maybe there is something in the life worth living for, I‚Äôll try get through this. Eventually I went to my GP and reached out for some help. 


The therapy I tried was awful, and didn‚Äôt make any impact. I tried getting on with things on my own and I thought I was getting better, I set goals, ended a relationship that was dragging me down emotionally and mentally, I felt good. I was making progress. I was doing well. 


But then recently my best friend who I care more about than absolutely anything on this godforsaken planet used me as a rebound. He tore my world down with his lies, killed my dreams by leaving me numb and practically spat on my will to live. I‚Äôm done.

I‚Äôve actually settled on how I want to go. Every day I wake up and my heart races at the knowledge I‚Äôm still alive, so every day I expose myself to how I want to go and slowly I feel more at ease knowing that it‚Äôs all going to be over soon. 

Every time I think about how life might be like if I don‚Äôt go through with it, but the thought makes me sick. I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. I don‚Äôt even think I want to discuss it, I‚Äôm not really sure why I‚Äôm posting here. To vent I guess. 


Stupidest part of all this is that I still love him. Still care about him. I‚Äôd do almost anything for him... but I won‚Äôt carry on living for him. I won‚Äôt even do it for myself. 
I want to be angry at him, so help me god I do, but I can‚Äôt. We have so much history. He‚Äôs not a bad person. Cutting him out of my life isn‚Äôt an option, as that leads me back to wanting to end my life. 


Everything points back to one outcome, and I take some comfort in knowing that. Not every life has is precious. The only impact of me dying is loved ones having to clear out my possessions. I bring no value to anyone else‚Äôs existence unless I‚Äôm being used for something.

allow me to explain, see, I got into a depression when I was about 10-11 and it lasted till I was 16-17 but I have obtained the notion that life is an overall negative, most of our time is spend doing things we don't want to (school, work, taxes, traffic jams, other obligations/nuisances), and all of evolution is dependent on the death of the genetically inferior and struggle for survival. This is a very deep conviction I hold to be truth.

While I am out of a depression I still maintain this belief and in all honesty think that death is just an objective better state then life, it is easy to keep living to not hurt my friends and family which I find too egotistical of an action to do. But I would very much like to join most of my fellow man and believe that life is actually a positive thing that should be cherished or atleast that death isn't a better alternative.

im..scared of dying. very scared. death terrifies me, im not religious, its just..nothing. its so scary. but yet i just want everything to finally be over, no more pain, no more..anything. its a funny conflict i think. 

ive been reaching out for help, sort of. my therapist told my dad i was suicidal, and he took it..bad to say the least. got defensive when i told him i felt like a failure, saying ‚Äúwell i dont pressure you anymore.‚Äù he asked me ‚ÄúWhat do you even have to be sad about? Sure the worlds awful but thats not just happening to you right now.‚Äù etc. Whats worse is he thinks it was a good conversation. that it was positive, helpful. He loves me, he does, hes just so fuckinn stupid with emotions. i swear to god he went to college for psychology but cant understand that sometimes youre just fucking sad for no goddamn reason. my therapist is looking for outpatient treatment for me. i dont think i can wait long enough anymore.

i had the realization recently that i *can* die. theres always been a subconcious ‚Äúyes other people kill themselves, but that wont happen to you. you cant do it. youre not going to die.‚Äù but i sorta just..realized.

250153,"QuestionEveryone around me says ""Time heals all wounds,"" but honestly... does it really? I don't think so. Not at all. It just seems like bullshit people say when bad stuff happens. So what I'm asking is whether or not if it's true? That time heals all wounds... But before you answer, here is a bit of backstory.

Parents split up when I was 7. It made me sad, yes, and it caused a lot of problems for me, yes, but I don't think I was ever truly depressed about that. I had thoughts, but the thoughts were never about killing myself. Just wishing that I was gone from this world. 

Suicidal thoughts truly started when I was 14. When my mother was killed. She had just picked me and little brother up from school. Little did we know that an ex-boyfriend of hers, one that me and little brother looked up to as a FATHER, was waiting for us at the home. He shot her in the shoulder, but the bullet came of her neck. It says she died of exsanguination, but she drowned in her own blood. Then, the man shot himself in the head. 

I saw it all. By the time the day was over, I had blood all over me. On my clothes, on my face, on my hands, and somehow in my hair... It was horrible. I started cutting myself shortly after. I started to vividly imagine how I killed myself, what my funeral would look like, the whole shabang. But... I didn't suffer alone. Everyone, even people outside of the family, was affected, but I gotta say that it affected my little brother and our grandma the most.

 Little Brother was only 5 when it happened, but he was by far the clingiest child out of me, him, and our older brother. He followed our mom everywhere that she went, sort of like a shadow. School was already hard for him, so when our mother died, it became even worse and the teachers and staff did nothing to help him. He actually had to repeat Kindergarten. He is now home-schooled, but I have no idea if that's making things any better. It doesn't seem like it as he always says that if I die or our Grandma dies, he is gonna die too.

Grandma... Well, she lost a child. Not to even mention that the year before, she lost her mother. On top of that, she suddenly had to raise two, emotionally-damaged kids. It was hard. She constantly wishes that she was dead, not our mother. She tells me as such and it kills me inside. Because, yeah, I wanna die, too, but I can't. I can't as I have to be the 'mother' to little brother and 'best friend' to Grandma because that was what my mother was to them.

I'll be 18 in a month or so. Even though I resisted the urge to self-harm since I was 16, I relapsed today and my thighs are a bloody mess. Grandma doesn't know. She thinks I'm doing okay, but I haven't at all. I've tried though.

So, uh, yeah, is it going to eventually get better? Thanks for reading my word-vomit, btw, if you did. ",suicide

66435,"I'm a horrible person and no amount of good deeds will change that. I hate being miserable most of the time, but it seems to be my default.   I am a terrible person and I don‚Äôt know why. Before you chime in with good intentions, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a malicious or evil person, just not a very good one. I have tried to devote my life to being a kinder, nicer, more altruistic type but it does nothing to change my natural tendency for rottenness. I work in social services specifically helping those with mental health or homelessness issues, I don‚Äôt tell (and sometimes actually hide) when I do something nice for another person, I try to recycle, donate, turn off lights. I give to charity, tell the cashier when they missed an item, smile at strangers, hold doors open, give up the last of something for someone else, and I make a point of knowing little things about people so when I do something special, sometimes randomly to make them feel good, it‚Äôs a little extra personal. I could continue padding my ‚Äúgood deeds resume‚Äù but I‚Äôll get to the point. 


  It makes me feel good to do these things, but sometimes I think I only do them to balance out how shitty I am or have been. I‚Äôve lied, cheated, stolen, drank too much and screamed, threw things, said the most horrible hurtful things I could possibly imagine to those I care most about. I think awful things about others, usually just comparing them to myself in regards to looks and achievements because I have such a low self esteem. Being mean, in my head only, makes me feel superior in a way. I hate my partner‚Äôs cat even though I am such an animal person (mostly dogs) and this cat is the most friendly and cuddly one I‚Äôve met. The cat likes to sit on my partner‚Äôs lap and stare at me smugly, like it thinks it owns the place. My dog knows who the leader is, but this cat just walks around sticking its dumb nose into food unless I clap my hands at it. It won't ever stop trying to sneak where it isn‚Äôt allowed, and even though the cat isn‚Äôt actually doing anything wrong, I just don‚Äôt want it around. If I hear it come out of its room area, I get up and get something to drink because I know it will scare the cat back to its bed and away from me and my partner.

  I am constantly irritable, sarcastic, and quick to lash out even though I have tried very hard to, sometimes literally, bite my tongue. In the moment I just can‚Äôt tell I‚Äôm being mean or harsh.  I am on the verge of leaving my partner every time things get tough despite loving them so much. I don‚Äôt deserve them yet every few weeks I start to think low of them and how I would be better off single. I think this for almost no reason. It‚Äôs not just them, I‚Äôve done it to every partner- except the ones I became erratic and crazy with after sleeping together once. I want to marry my partner, be content more than contemplative, but know we will divorce because I‚Äôll end up divorcing anyone I end up marrying. It‚Äôs like every inch of my body rejects any sort of happiness, or confidence, or optimism. It‚Äôs like I have an inability to be happy, like I enjoy being miserable. People describe me as nice, bubbly, caring but I know inside I‚Äôm on a perpetual spiral of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong this week‚Äù, ‚Äúhow can I fuck this up‚Äù, ‚Äúhow am I better/worse than this person‚Äù or my favorite ‚Äúlet's take every and any happy memory and sour it‚Äù. 

Yes I‚Äôve seen a counsellor, since I was a child actually. Yes I tried and am on medication, which helped me get past depression fatigue and get my life in order and functioning.  But really it only uncovered that deep down I am bad natured and no amount of good deeds with change that. I‚Äôm rotten and will stay miserable and mean forever. I‚Äôm probably a narcissist and am just blaming my past on why I‚Äôm so inclined to be greedy, mean spirited, and selfish. I just don‚Äôt know that I can take it anymore.

45609,"He doesn't know that I bought a rope.My boyfriend and I have gotten into another argument for the millionth time this week. I know that the problem is me but I can't see it. I hurt him so much. Nobody loves me. I made friends with the wrong people. My family is just horrible. I finally realized today that it was all me when my partner and my sister just looked at me like I was insane. You know that you're the one at fault when everyone tells you that you're wrong. But I just wanted some affection. I just wanted him to just hug me until the anger went away. I want doctors to examine my brain and ask my boyfriend and possibly others (which I doubt would help since not many people know me that well) about my behavior.

 My boyfriend and I think that I have Borderline Personality Disorder and I think that my mental health has gotten worse, I hit my head almost constantly and as hard as I could to possibly knock my self out and just as a way of self harm. Maybe that fucked me up. My physical health is shit now too, I'm trying to starve myself and I hit my chest, where my heart is to try to get it to stop and to hurt myself. It hurts so much now since yesterday, especially now that my boyfriend punched me in the heart today during our fight. I tried to overdose so much in the past that I know for sure that it will never work. I can't count how many times that I tried to kill myself. I did it so much that in the past my boyfriend told me that maybe I was meant to live and what if something was preventing me from dying. I just dismissed that comment and took it as some corny ass way to inspire me to live. Heh, that idiot. I love him. It is easy for anyone here to say to live and get over him but the thing is that to me, it's more than just a break up. It's losing the last person that I have, the only person that I've loved and the only person that has ever cared about me. 

You need to understand what I've been through to describe this feeling. I've had so many bad dreams at night. I've cried for hours non stop yesterday and this entire week. The only pain that I can compare this to and to get a normal person to understand is to imagine everyone that you have ever loved and care about dying every single day and having the worst and the most unbearable mental pain imaginable and thinking that you cannot continue to live anymore. This made my boyfriend understand a bit more. I think that any normal person would be numb with all this pain but it feels like I'm reliving every single moment of every single painful thing in my life. The pain never goes away. I just want him again, he said that he didn't love me. I know he does or he at least cared about me in some way but he's just hurt. He's the only thing that I have. My love, my family and my best friend. I bought a cream that he needed for his infection along with my rope. I will drop it off his place before I hang myself. I want to do one last thing for him, even if it's small. That was all the money that I had.

Just so much shit has happened to me that I can write a story on how I lost all my friends, how my best friend betrayed me and turned out to be a complete sociopath, how I assaulted people, how I almost got raped twice, my physical and sexual abuse at home, my sadist and masochistic tendencies, fucked up interests. My entire life is a complete fucking mess and in the end it fucked me up. Now, it's me. I've hurt an innocent person and I am just continuing the cycle. And I realized that I turned someone that was a complete opposite of me into someone that is just like me.

I am going to die. I just needed to let this out and let people know how others have lived and to please be kind to your loved ones. This shit has been literally a fucking storybook tragedy.

But i'm tired of living in a world like this one. i want to quit the race, i have been hospitalized after calling the suicide hotline and i realized it's complete bullshit and they just give you shitty drugs and worse therapy.

Drugs like alcohol and cannabis help very little. I try to take my mind off killing myself but i can't. It has become essentially a mental habit i cannot control, throughout the day at work or at home it always comes back to mind. I have gone to sleep thinking about it, and recently it was the first thing i thought about when i woke up.

My only comfort i have is knowing how short and fragile life can be and hope that it coincidentally and conveniently ends soon. I just want to die all the time. I don't feel it's like a physical thing like a chemical imbalance, but more of a mental thing.

I've thought about it as rationally as i think i can. If i end my life, my family will morn, my friends will eventually move on.

and i realize there is selfishness to it, and i know it's fucked up to think this way, but it won't matter when i'm dead, i won't have to worry and stress about it after the fact.

This planet has 7 Billion people living on it, no one will notice one missing, and i promise you, the world will keep on spinning around like it has for years, like nothing ever happened, at best another statistic.

When i was younger i had more of a spark, but now i see a world full of horrible, cruel, selfish people lacking empathy. The rich do not care for the poor and the powerful do not care about the powerless.

i have a few things that i do enjoy, and maybe if i try i can make my job something resembling a hobby i enjoy, but I have no purpose and unlikely to find one.

I was raised religiously as christian, and slowly become atheist but I've gone back to being agnostic, to pray if God does exist, to please kill me.

i would rather die than to live robotically throughout life just to pay my taxes, and if i don't do it now, i will, even if it's a few years from now.

I do not fear death anymore, i welcome and embrace the relief it brings with it.",suicide

10045,"8 YearsIt's been almost 8 years.

Since I was 14 this has hung over my head. Not a cloud like all these tawndry commercials you see for Zoloft, Prozac, Celexa... or whatever the new drug is... No it's more like a pitch blackedness. I'm 22 now. I have no one. I have nothing. In these 8 years I have rarely had any human connection. Occasionally (twice) I had something, but the first was built on toxic soil, and the second? ruined either by me or something unseen. I will die, I've accepted as much, and its not even because of her. I hope she realizes that. I don't want to hurt her, or anyone that ""loves"" me. But there is a point of no return. Everyone I talk to wants to tell me there is, I assure though, there is not. I have been in every room in my mind palace. Noticed every crack in the moulding, every flaw. I'm no carpenter and there isn't any for many many miles. I am not even sad, nor numb. I ruined my chance a very long time ago. Tell me everyone has flaws? Hah. Not like these, I've wanted to say something to the people who want to ""help"" me for a long time. ""If you were put in my shoes, you would've killed yourself by now""... As if I am somehow stronger then they could ever be because of this. Maybe that's how I can so easily justify it. Dying. But do I not have a right to die? It's my life, there are 8 billion humans on this planet. We are essentially an infestation. Regardless, the fact of the matter is I cannot accomplish what I need for a happy life. I could sit back and become complacent like the rest of the world. Prevent circumstance from driving mental force and be ""happy"" (sometimes) but I don't want that. I want perpetual happiness. Disappointing thing is that for most people and for me in particular you can't get that alone. I could be content with life. I was recently. Then she came along, most beautiful creature I'd ever seen. I was elated, enchanted. Worst part being it was mutual. I could feel the energy I put in her. How  happy she was. Nothing else mattered, maybe that was the mistake, but who gives a fuck anyway? I am trapped in layers upon layers built over years and years of coagulation. I wasn't even who I wanted to be before, which means on-top of conquering everything I have to restructure myself, build the person I desire to be. I am though. Becoming the person I desire to be. Companies frothing at the mouth to interview with me because on paper they see a real asset. And it may be true, I've always been someone who appreciates efficiency. But the endless loop of my humanity brings me back to this place. My lack of capital making the changes I am trying to facilitate borderline impossible. The overwhelming gloom I feel everytime I see a memory of what was. I can't even appreciate some of the music I did before because music was what started us. She thinks I am something I am not and furthers that for herself with false empowerment. Thanks, wish I had the ability to do that. Oh well. I've got my date. Hopefully everything I've put infront of that door will stop me. I doubt it... but who knows...",suicide

117726,"why I want to kill myself(I'm sorry if I make some mistakes, I'm still learning english) my mother told me when my brother was a baby he was very loud and I was the opposite. when I  cried she didn't pick me up till I fall asleep because I wasn't crying loud enough. 
20 years later she didn't change. she took care of my brother, loving him and supporting him all the time and I am very grateful for that since he is my brother and I only wish him the best but she left me alone, she judge me, insult me all the time , wishing me to die every day, given punches on my back while I was sleeping and after I couldn't breathe. telling my brother while he is beating me to do it harder, humiliating me in public, with my friends, teachers, making fun of me, having no social life because I was beaten if I was late and then I just didn't want to go anywhere because I wanted to avoid all of screams and slaps from my dad and I got used to it and now I can't have a normal relationships with anyone and that includes school or job. 
I lived for years knowing that I should repress anything and not feel weak. I shouldn't feel like I have to be loved because it's lame.
every person of my age never said something positive about me because I was cold and I acted like I didn't need it so they slowly were gone from my life. I looked so not interested all the time and I never reached them. 
I was very apathetic and distant and I barely talked. 
I never felt being alone since I was always by myself, I don't know the difference. 
I never did the things that teenagers do, having a boyfriend or girlfriend, going out for parties, having groups, smoking, going out in the night, drinking, having the first kiss ecc. 
I was convinced in my head that I don't deserve those things, I'm not the kind of person that should have those things or having fun, those are not the things that I deserve. 
and of course my mom told me that no one is gonna love me or be with me because I'm just don't have anything to love for. 
the only thing that my mom tells me to do it's house work, it's the only thing that comes out of her mouth when she calls me. when I'm in the state that I can't get out of my bed she just doesn't care and punches me or yell at me, insult me, wish me to die just because I'm not doing what she wants. 
she talks to me just when she needs me and I just don't want to do it if that's the only reason. 
when I was at the psychiatrist my parents were talking and insulting me all the time in front of her and the worst part is that she agreed and gave me a medicine for kids ( I was 17 years old) and told me it's my fault that it's not working and my parents till this day say to me that it's my fault that I am the way that I am (depressed) because I decide to be like this. 
I can't go to school or having a job because I don't have the mental and physical strength. 
it's been more than 4 years that I don't have friends, I only talk to people online witch I'm not friends with them anymore because the only thing that they did to me is hurting me repeatedly and using me for attention for years. 
I'm all alone in a country that I don't know the language, I don't know no one and I don't have anything.
I'm currently in the situation where I am continuously repeated in my face that I should get out of the house because no one cares about me.
I want to get out but I don't have any money and I can't have a job in this state. 
my mental state it's getting at the point that I don't have any strength to kill myself since I am so weak.
I really don't have anything to live for, I just don't feel life in me.
and if I hear someone say it will get better I can't comprehend how is it possible for someone to be so selfish and not understand that there is nothing to be better for people like me.
there is nothing to adjust, there is just nothing. 
so please don't console me, don't help me to live when I don't want to and help me to get out of this situation.",suicide

some of you may need to hear this, some of you won't care, some of you will think it's utterly ridiculous. but God loves you, no matter how much you are going through, how much you've done, you're forgiven.

God is always close but he is closer than ever right now. with the tragic things happening every month, there's no way it's just a coincidence..it's almost a punishment for the horrible things humanity has gotten into. you may think he isn't a loving God, but if a judge let a criminal off without punishment, would they be a good judge?  this world is falling apart. he is ready, he's coming soon, try to be prepared.",non-suicide

I have nowhere to ask, hence why I am asking here. There are communities made for questions like these, but the people there take way to long to respond. 

I am in the market for an iPad. I have wanted one for over a year. I will use it for a variety of things, with one example being school-work. 

I am going to be purchasing one tomorrow. I was going to purchase the iPad Air IV, directly from Apple. 

This was when I found out someone is selling a sealed (on Kijiji) iPad Pro for $900.00, one-hundred dollars more than the Air IV, but $200.00 cheaper that buying it outright from Apple. 

He has proof of purchase/receipt and it comes with the warranty. 

He said I can open it/check it out before purchasing it. 

However, I am still a bit suspicious. What do you think? 

I do not want to buy the Pro directly from Apple. It is not worth the extra money. It is a difference of $300.00. However, a $100.00 difference is not that big of a deal, and is worth it in my eyes.

Im super relieved though. When I was walking around, getting ready to find a place to do it, and it was totally cathartic, I felt good about my decision. Usually I'd get anxious, and coward out, but this was just so simple for me. But someone found me hours later apparently.

116636,"I'm here partially because of suicide but also because I may hurt others and others may hurt themselves if I do what's right.Honestly, the last year of my life has been a living hell but it's also been very eye-opening. About a year ago, I suddenly began to develop seemingly arbitrary anxiety attacks. Nothing traumatic happened, nothing major changed in my life - my heart rate just randomly started spiking up to 140-150 BPM when I'm doing things like sitting or watching videos. After suffering with these anxiety attacks about 2-4 times a week, I reached my breaking point and I was literally ready to kill myself and take others with me. During my period of suffering I met a girl who at first seemed like the ideal girl for me but things quickly went south when her BPD started getting in the way. Her insecurities are just something I couldn't deal with. Overtime, I went from being depressed and feeling hopeless about the entire situation to angry. I didn't understand why any of this was happening to me. I was an otherwise normal guy in my mid-20's when this disease just began manifesting itself for no apparent reason. I was finished, done for, I wanted to kill myself and go out with a bang. I wanted to take others with me. I dialed the suicide helpline and I spoke to somebody for an hour straight. At the end of the call, an anxiety attack manifested itself and I called 9-11 for what seems to be the millionth time. I just couldn't take it anymore. My mind was racing. My heart was pumping faster than it ever has. I was feeling weak, dizzy. They took tests, they gave me medicine, they did everything they could and I think I've been to the ER more than anybody active in this subReddit combined. 

""It's just anxiety, you'll get it over it.""

""Here's some xanax and some SSRI's, take them and you'll get better""

""You need to see a psychologist""


And so I did. I didn't get better. I had planned my suicide down to the very smallest of details, and nobody knew. Not even her. Then, I had a day of clarity. My anxiety dissipated. I felt OK for one day. Wonderful. Great. Sleep. Wake up. I feel better. I take a shower. I eat. Normally it's triggered by now. Everything is fine. Another day. No anxiety. I continued to live. Day. By. Day. I delayed suicide just one more day. Then, just one more day. Then, just one more day. Two weeks passed of blissful normalcy. Then, I started hallucinating. I started to hear voices and only for just one day. I started to see lights, I started to see shadows surrounding me. Everything got darker. I nearly passed out on the street. I called the ambulance. Checked by ER. Nothing is wrong. It's just anxiety. 

**It's just anxiety**

But no, it isn't. It can't be. Something must be wrong. The voices, the hallucinations, the colors, the darkness. I'm schizophrenic, but I couldn't be. I told myself I needed to fight this disease because I'm too good for it. I can't have schizophrenia. I just can't. I filtered the voices in my head out and I used everything in my will-power to bring myself to normalcy one more time. Just as fast as the voices and hallucinations came, they left. It's been months since.

You may reading this and thinking I'm crazy. Crazy is a broad term to me. I don't feel like you either be crazy or not. I think it's a spectrum. Some people are more crazy than others, but they may not be labelled as crazy. Did I think I was crazy? Do I think that I'm crazy now? No. But this anxiety sure is driving me crazy!

So more months passed, and my girlfriend's BPD seemingly started to get worse. And I seemingly got better. I used all the money I worked for to do a downpayment on a nice car and I've been living my life the way I've wanted to. I don't listen to others, I do whatever the fuck I want. Do I want to drive out to that sushi restaurant and order too much food and take it all to go? You bet your ass I do. Do I want to speed in residential streets and narrowly avoid the cops? Sure I fucking do. I'm in control of my life. I've always been in control of my life, it's just that my control slipped for last couple of months and when it did, I almost did the most terrible things know to man. I'd appear on news stations, guaranteed. But I was better now. I'm normal again. I started taking road trips with my girlfriend and my friends and we have had an absolute blast. I have loved every single minute of it. 

Then, my girlfriend did a shit-test on me. She asked me if I watch porn. I said yes. Ever since then, her insecurity has grown massively and she even **attempted suicide** because I wasn't willing to compromise with her. She wanted me to straight up stop watching porn. I wouldn't. 

I was initially going to talk about how all of this has fueled my anger and it has made me into a vile human being that's been wanting to selfishly kill but I decided to just stop. I texted my girlfriend right now and I broke up with her in the most terrible way possible. I'm emotionally hurting so much right now. I didn't want to do it because she might kill herself but I can't fucking handle it anymore. 

We had such a great time. 

I loved her so much.

Anyway, I had an argument with my parents, and that's something that always brings it out. Typically, we never fight (maybe once a year, or once every eighteen months) because I stay out of trouble and do good in college. Well when we got into this fight, I went into my room to cool off, so I didn't say anything stupid. While I was in my room, I reverted into my one of my worst states, using all my energy to keep suicide off my mind.

Even as I'm typing this, I realize how many issues I have. I'm afraid. I've never been able to admit that to myself because I've never been able to talk anonymously. I guess I do need some counselling at the least. I use marijuana irregularly, and its been one of the most helpful things I've ever used in helping fight my depression. So for this reason, I know I can get better. There has to be a way, if drugs can help, I've got to be able to reach that place without them. I just don't know how.

Any advice, I feel like I'm at my wit's end here, and I don't want to end up trying to kill myself like I used to. That much I know, I want to live.

234335,"I'm thirteen, and I need some guidance.Hi.
I'm a thirteen year old girl, and I may be suffering from depression.

A few months ago I did something horribly stupid, and I can't get over it. I am a generally smart person, but the mistake I made makes me rethink things.

I stole something, and I'm not proud of it. I have not been caught, but I have a feeling that I will eventually suffer the legal consequences for my actions. At first, I felt that adrenaline rush. It felt exciting and rebellious. I didn't realize what I had truly done until I got home, and froze in fear. I reassured myself by thinking that the police couldn't catch me; I was safe at home.

This consoled me for two months.

One night, the guilt came crashing back down. I couldn't sleep, couldn't think or function properly. I had to tell someone, so I told my mother. My mom is a kind, understanding person. She took it considerably well, and told me to *never* do it again.

So I was fine after that, still sad, but fine.

School started recently. I thought it would help take my mind off of things, give me something else to focus on. It didn't. It only got worse, to put it simply. I started to have suicidal thoughts; I wondered what would happen if I just left the world.

I'll go back to the main reason of my sadness: I'm a good person. I went to a nice private school, did all the right things, followed the rules. Something so sudden and rash to happen like that was a huge emotional blow. I couldn't accept the fact that someone like me could make such a dumb error in life.

Trust me, I've learned my lesson. I've also read about the laws related to juvenile theft in my state. This seems to comfort me a bit.

I don't feel like I'm good at anything anymore. I can't do certain jumps or spins in ice skating, I'm not in any honor classes.

54740,"Just trying to come to terms with it allI have been fighting myself for years now.. I have never been able to tell anyone what I'm really thinking. Everyone thinks that I'm happy and making plans for my future. I know that if they had any idea what was really in my mind they would be shocked. Everyday for years.. my mind seems to revolve around the idea of just ending it. Over and over. When it gets bad I try my best to be logical about it.. that it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. But it just seems like these temporary problems keep coming at me to the point that it's hard to breathe. When I'm driving I think, ""what if I just kept going straight instead of taking this curve?"" or ""what if that car veered off into my lane and I didn't swerve out of the way?"" ...Or I'll take a bath and see how long I can stay underwater without breathing.. I feel so disgusted with myself everyday.

Both of my parents were druggies who were here and gone and in and out of jail. So my childhood pretty much sucked. I was in shelters/foster homes on 2 separate occasions. From the ages of 7 to 15 I was molested by different men. It started out with my brother making me get into a makeshift room with his friends little brother while he and his friend watched through holes while they made us rub against each other.. that brother molested me on and off until I was a teenager. Then there was my mother's boyfriend.. that one hurt the most. I thought of him as my second father.. we were so close.. but when I was 12 he shoved his fingers inside me and tried to rape me. Even though I told my mother about it, she still talks to him 11 years later.. and then there were a few men during the time I lived with my mother while she was dealing drugs. One night I woke up to a man masturbating with my feet. Needless to say, I was a pretty fucked up kid. And ever since then I have had twisted thoughts regarding sex and penetration. Even the thought of putting my fingers or a dildo inside of me makes me physically sick.

Recently, I had a short wave of hope. I am in my senior year of college. And though my depression has affected my grades a bit, I am close to graduating. But then the anxiety of knowing that I probably won't be able to get a job after all this makes me feel smothered and there's constantly a huge weight on my chest. Anyway.. though I am paying for college myself, I always had it covered.. even though it got really tight sometimes. But this year.. since it is my 5th year.. some of my grants were no longer applicable.. and I got all the finaid I could get.. and still ended up 2k short. So I started applying for jobs everywhere.. and I had one hope from them all.. but then the guy blew me off at the last second.. But I had one more hope.. when my grandmother passed away she left me her land. So I have been talking to someone about buying it.. but now she's getting hard to get in touch with and I'm 85% sure she changed her mind. On top of that, my car broke down so I am car-less. I have zero friends here anymore.. and I'm so stressed.. I feel so anxious about having to drop out of college come mid December and being homeless.. and I just don't know if I can do this anymore.. I know that these issues may seem so small... but I feel paralyzed. I just felt that I had to get this off my chest, even if it's just to a bunch of strangers on the internet.. but I think that I am going to make a bet.. if my land sells then I will stay here a little longer and graduate college and try to find a job.. but if it doesn't sell.. I will box all of my belongings so no one has to be bothered.

The last time I was really happy was about two years ago, and all this depression started when my girlfriend left me. Admittedly, i wasn't great beforehand but she was the only thing holding me together. 

Then I endured the final year of high school, It damn near killed me. I was depressed, I struggled with anxiety which prevented me from sleeping well, which made me unable to focus at school. My grades went to shit, despite be being a smart kid.  

I ended up having to settle for a different university course because my final score was so abysmal. I hate the course I'm doing, but the hope is that maybe it'll lead to a job I like. 

But in the mean time I'm working as a cashier at a grocery store. and I fucking hate it. I have autism and social anxiety disorder, so dealing with people gets me very panicked and my whole job is centred around customer service. I've tried finding other jobs but to no avail. I can't quit because I need income.   
I've been working for 3 years and I was told my anxiety would get better but it's gotten much worse. My last shift resulted in my having a full anxiety attack, I routinely suffer migraines, chest pains, dizziness and nausea and quite frankly, I don't think that's healthy .

I've tried medication but none of it works, the only drug that works is the sleeping pill, and while i can sleep better, my anxiety and depression are still running rampant.  

I'm working a job that I'm nearly in tears just thinking about, I'm studying a course I don't enjoy because of my past fuck ups that still haunt me, I don't drive because it terrifies me to my core and that makes going places difficult.  
And fuck, I don't even have a girlfriend or something else to fall back on and go ""oh at least I have this thing in my life that makes it worth living"" 


I used to enjoy life, I don't anymore. I have nothing that makes me want to get out of bed in the morning.  

I'm only 19, which means I probably got like 50 more years of this shit.  
I just want to fucking end it now, nothings changed, nothing gets better, no matter how hard I try, I'm going to be stuck in a shit job, filled with anxiety, unable to drive anywhere, to scared to talk to people, I'm never gonna have a family of my own, never going to be able to live my life how I want.

Years later I found someone else and i thought he is the right guy, we dated for 3 years and we are married now, but days before marriage he lost his job, it‚Äôs been 2 years since he has no job and he is frustrated and he is not good with me anymore, he lashes it out all at me, he expects me to work outside and then come back and work at home while he watches Netflix all day. I have refused to work at home straight up since he barely moves his ass whole day and it is now coming to being abusive, blaming me for everything while I am the only one trying hard. Why is my life so messed up and extremely hard? I have been thinking of suicide since 10 years but I feel like now is the time. No body cares about me, Yes i know NOONE, I don‚Äôt have much friends since nobody is friends with a depressed loner. I just want to end my life. All i wanted was a happy family with kids. That‚Äôs all i wanted from life and everyone has it, and I have been trying so hard for it and life tells me to f* off, i want to tell life to f* off. I want this to end and die in peace!!!",suicide

236157,"They said the pain was temporary and I believed them, but it feels like it will never go awayI'm just 17... and I've been suicidal for many years now. Never on the verge of actually going through with it, but daydreaming on and on about it for hours everyday. 

I feel that I know things about the world that humans weren't designed to know, or pursue knowledge about. My barrier of doubt is broken and I truly believe in all these ""surreal"" ideas. I've tried to discuss it with others but they don't pay attention, or they call me delusional. It's only normal, we're designed to only care about the physical aspects of the world. But I can't, I just can't feel happiness with my or everyone else's existence. 

When I'm happy, I know that it is temporary and I also can't shake the fact that I'm only feeling this way because of chemicals released in my brain. I can't shake the fact that I'm purely a puppet controlled by who knows what. Whatever's controlling me wants me to live, I'm wired to want to survive like all other living organisms and viruses.

And sure. Maybe I am crazy and delusional, but only by what other humans think. Or maybe I'm not insane and it's a normal human reflex to doubt these things for the protection of our species. I've just learned to keep this information to myself, just trap it within my own brain. And this is what makes me want to kill myself. I'm tired of being so alone. I'm not physically alone, I'm living such a good life, surrounded by many people supporting me. But I'm alone in my head. No one's going to believe me so there's no point in trying. I just have to give in to the puppet master's desires and care about this microscopic world. 

I have to dumb myself down to present myself to others. I wish that I could just end it all. I'm tired of everyone looking at me like I'm the odd one out when I show a glimpse of my true self. The only thing keeping me going is the tiny slither of hope that I'll meet someone who knows how I feel. I just want someone to understand what I am feeling and describing without seeing me as someone insane because they know ""it"" as well. I'm dreaming for that day to come.",suicide

300039,"Desperate for someone to talk toThis is my first post here. My name is Maria, I'm a 23 year old female from Virginia.

My life has been a big mess lately. Lots of financial problems that I just can't seem to get out of. Things just keep happening and I keep messing up.

I've been dealing with depression since I was in seventh grade and it just seems to get worse as time goes on. There's days I don't want to get out of bed. It makes it worse because I have physical medical problems (irritable bowel syndrome) that seem to completely take over my life in a bad way sometimes. I miss a lot of work over it, and though I have fmla, I still worry about losing my job.

I wouldn't say I'm suicidal lately, as I'm scared of death and dying, but sometimes I think it would be nice if I fell into a coma or something just so I wouldn't have to deal with life for a while.

I live with my long term boyfriend, and we messed up back in March and might be getting evicted soon. We have two dogs and the second one we got wasn't as potty trained as we thought when we adopted him. He's pretty much ruined our living room floor carpet, and our apartment complex served us with a court order, an unlawful detainment I believe it's called, because they want our property back. The court date is tomorrow and we only found out today because we had to stop by the rental office today and the lady working there mentioned it. She said they mailed us the summons, but we never received it.

So I may be homeless soon, my mom said I could move back in with her and her parents if they do evict us, but that would leave my boyfriend with nowhere to go.  We already know we will likely end up giving our second dog away, but it's breaking my heart, especially if we wind up having to give away our other dog. She was my first dog ever and I've developed a huge attachment to her over the couple years we have had her.

I'm hoping that explaining our situation to the judge tomorrow, admitting we messed up and have been trying to fix it, and that we are more than willing to replace the carpet and pay for the damages and move once our lease is done, I'm hoping the judge takes pity and just doesn't serve us with an eviction.

It's half past midnight and our court appointment is in less than 11 hours. I can't sleep, I've been crying all evening, and I'm such a bundle of nerves, I've tossed my dinner and I still feel sick to my stomach. My boyfriend is asleep and I don't really have many friends, the ones I do have are all asleep. I'm just desperate for someone to talk to, so I don't have to feel so alone right now.

I can talk on here, or text, or IM, or email.  I appreciate anyone who is willing to keep me company in my time of need right now. It hurts feeling like I'm at the bottom of a hole and can't see the light out.",suicide

People have expressed how important I am to them, how much they love me and how much I‚Äôve done for them in their life but I just feel nothing except for wanting to stop living.

Me and a male friend we sleeping over when we were 8 years old. This was when we were first discovering masterbateing/porn. He showed me a couple of videos, and we decided to try out one of the things we saw, a blowjob. Problem is we were both very inexperienced (obviously) and also absolute idiots. So, he took off his pants (i was still clothed) and I tried to suck on it, even though it was completely flaccid. After like 5 minutes and him finally getting hard, he orgasmed. But didn't cum, instead he fuckin pissed in my mouth (which I guess is the origin of that fetish). After that whole detachable, we didn't go any farther in our ""relationship"" and stayed as friends. I still have him in my contacts, but haven't talked to him in like 4 years.

The suicidal thoughts never end, I think about it daily. I can just imagine the bastards tweeting some bullshit like ""another suicide at our school, guess nobody learns"" I can imagine them all saying stuff about how everyone loved me, and no one was rude. That's the only reason I haven't gone through and done it yet, because I think it would be a waste if I didn't get to see how everyone reacts and fronts on some bullshit like how much everyone loved me.

I haven't actually made an attempt but I've gotten close a few times over the past couple of years. Sometimes the only thing keeping me from grabbing a razor or pills is the thought of how much it would destroy the people I love, but I've also thought about how I could tank my following and pre-emptively drive away my loved ones so nobody would miss me. Has anyone else dealt with this stuff? I know other people with body image issues but none so strong they regularly inspire intrusive thoughts of suicide.",suicide

just thinking about how i'd tell others i won't go to that city made me think about what if i just still go there, but not to her place and instead just look around, stay up through the night, renting a hotel room for a night, writing letters to those 2 or 3 loved ones, sending them out and then do it.

But I can't handle being lonely. I love everything about military life, I know its intense, but I like being busy, I wanna explore, I wanna get stressed out, but being ignored is just too much. At this point I think im the toxic one in the group, at the same time they walk all over me. I ask them to hang out, they say they are working, next day I see them together on snapchat middle of the day. I try to be concise, honest, and not bother them, but even after leaving people alone for weeks or months they ignore me. I'm scared of making new friends, I have a history of suicide attempts, and the thoughts are starting to reemerge.  I just want to yell at my friends and demand to know why I get treated differently.

167885,"I just want somebody to tell me everything's gonna be okayHi. Thank you so much for reading this.

Basically, I'm a very lonely person with an empty life. 

I ended up with this ridiculous crush on this girl on this writing website. I'm such a fucking idiot. It breaks me, because I'm so shy in real life, and I know she'd never want me, since she already has a girlfriend, and I'm a fucking emotional disaster. I don't know why I bother with anything. I was so nice to her, probably too much. I just wanted her to be nice back to me, and she was, but I kind of wanted comfort, you know? I opened my heart too much, made myself too vulnerable. Now, I feel stupid, and a bit used.

Sometimes, people tell me I'm pretty or smart, and that feels great. But I'm not independent at all and that destroys anything I might possibly have going for me. I have a very over-protective family and since I'm so wounded from years of being alone, people think I'm batshit. I use kindness as a defense mechanism, but sometimes that backfires. 

I don't want to kill myself. I just want love, for once. I just wish somebody would care about me, comfort me, praise me. No one ever will, though. Not even out of pity. I never get a chance to build up confidence, because no one wants to bother making me feel worthwhile. I just for once want someone to tell me that everything will be okay. I mean, I could have my parents tell me that, but I don't want that. They mean well, but it's not the same. Like, please, someone just tell me that everything's gonna be okay, even though you don't know anything about me. I just want to hear it. I promise I won't get attached. Just tell me it'll be okay. Please. 

I've been rejected for being too clingy, too standoffish, too self-critical. I don't know how to not be these things. I've been alone so long, and I can't pretend that I'm okay with that anymore.
Thank you for reading this. Goodnight. 

Edit: Hi. I just wanted to say thank you all so much. I really needed that kind of support, and you all were so much kinder and more reassuring than I ever could have asked for. I'm moved, and I feel much better.  I just really needed to get that off of my chest. Thank you so much.",suicide

"" . it turns out he had an iphone and iphones dont break in pieces like that. at first he wanted to beat the teacher up for breaking his phone but after realizing that it couldnt be his phone he stopped. finally after every one was left confused the teacher says that he bough an broken phone just for such instances and that he put my classmates phone in his pocket then taking out the already broken out and smashing it. after giving him his phone back he said ""no seriously dont use your phones in my class"" and then continued the class. i was left SHOCKED i tell you. i still dont like him but that gave him huge bonus point in my mind.

I just wish I would‚Äôve been protected as a child. I wish I grew up learning how to process emotions. I wish my family wasn‚Äôt the way it is. I‚Äôm stuck like this and I know I just have to hang on but is there even any point anymore?

My future... won‚Äôt be good. I know it won‚Äôt. I feel so excited that one day I‚Äôll be able to live on my own and have my own space but I know there‚Äôll be something holding me down. There is always something that has to fuck even the tiniest things up so that nothing ever works smoothly for me. I‚Äôm tired of it.

And I‚Äôm trying to get help. I‚Äôm trying so hard. And in trying so hard to do my schooling which will fuck up my future even more if I fail. I just wish it was easier. I wish I wasn‚Äôt writing this at 9am when I fell asleep at 3am. I wish I could sleep without weed. I can‚Äôt even sleep longer than 6hrs with it.

And if one more fucking person asks me how much I weight, I‚Äôll literally fucking kill myself right then and there. My meds fucked me over and while I don‚Äôt feel as anxious anymore I also don‚Äôt have a goddamn appetite. Drs just tell me to force food. Weed is the only thing that can give me a bit of appetite. So leave me the fuck alone irl people.

I wanna fuck things over. I want to go crazy and tell everyone the fuck off. Tell them what I really feel about them. When I left my local school no one gave a shit. I left without notice and not a single person even contacted me to ask where I went. No one cared. But then I decide to post a photo on my insta wearing a crop top and finally being open about my DID and so many messages. I guess I‚Äôm only interesting when I have a fucking complex as hell disorder. 

But sometimes I want to live to be better than them and wow, what high expectations I have for myself. I know school isn‚Äôt everything and these people shouldn‚Äôt matter but I haven‚Äôt really had a real real friend that I didn‚Äôt fuck it up with. I always get way too attached and happy that I do or say something or I‚Äôm just annoying and clingy as hell. I wish people would just tell me if they don‚Äôt like me as a friend.

Sometimes I get so angry. Where I want to contact every person that has hurt me and just fucking tell them off. Tell them about how I literally attempted suicide so many times because of some of them. Then I fall back into the sadness. I just want happiness and stability. Is this all life is? Is it as terrible as it seems? Where I‚Äôll have to work unbearable hours to pay for basic supplies and a house. It doesn‚Äôt sound like a good time. I don‚Äôt see what the reward is for living. Children? I‚Äôm not bringing a child into this world and especially not adopting a kid if my housing sucks and it‚Äôs just me. I can‚Äôt do shit. 

I just kinda wish I had a choice. Or maybe a different upbringing. Selfish as hell, but it‚Äôs true. Maybe if I grew up different I wouldn‚Äôt be like this. Maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have to constantly wonder if my entire life and disorders are a delusion itself, which they could be, I don‚Äôt even know if they‚Äôre real or not. Who knows.

I have spent every day for the past few months studying for these exams, aiming to do really well and get into a top university. Every time I sit and study I get anxious, my heart rate increases, I can‚Äôt breathe, chest tightens and my ears go hot and red. I never knew why, and today I realised the reason. It‚Äôs because studying isn‚Äôt for me, working a 9-5 job, going to university, sitting at a desk for my whole life isn‚Äôt for me. I am one of those people you don‚Äôt think is depressed from the outside, I‚Äôm outgoing, funny, hardworking and friendly. I am so much more than a desk job, than an exam result. 


I thought this realisation would make me happy, I finally know why I‚Äôm getting anxious, but it‚Äôs made me feel more depressed than ever. I have goals for my end of year results, but without a vision of my future job theyre useless. I can‚Äôt see a future for myself, I can‚Äôt see a purpose, I can‚Äôt see happiness. I‚Äôm now stuck between continuing to study when my body physically rejects it or just giving up and regretting not trying for the rest of my life. 


And after all this I realised that I don‚Äôt want to be an adult, I don‚Äôt want to make decisions, I don‚Äôt want to have to plan and think, planning gives me anxiety because the future gives me anxiety. 


I‚Äôve been suicidal before, I‚Äôve been on antidepressants for almost two years, but this time it‚Äôs a feeling that‚Äôs so real and it feels like this is my destiny, this is my future, this is who I‚Äôm meant to be, this is my purpose, to be gone. 


I want to be forever young, forever innocent and clueless and careless. I don‚Äôt want to grow up, I don‚Äôt want to change. I want to be this way forever, I want to stay like this right now forever, every day that passes is a day I grow older.


Most of all, I want to be free, the source of my anxiety and depression is myself, and I can‚Äôt escape from myself. I want to let go, to feel nothing, to do what my body and my heart wants me to do. 


Soooo long story short I have decided I will not live past 18. I don‚Äôt want to be an adult, I don‚Äôt want to find out my vce results, I don‚Äôt want to make it to 2021.

202053,"This guilt is going to kill me. Possible TWI am riddled with guilt. Currently in a psych ward after a failed suicide attempt. As soon as I get out I am going to commit suicide, and I won‚Äôt fail this time. I guess this is my last attempt at seeking help/reassurance.
Background: I am 23F, suffer with Anorexia, OCD(Pure O), depression and BPD. 
Last year I was in a relationship with my then ex, for about 2 years. It was a pretty toxic/codependent relationship, mostly on my part due to my BPD abandonment issues, insecurity and paranoia.

I have always been very impulsive and reckless in the area of sex(as well as many other areas) never cared about using protection, always let men cum inside me etc without any form of contraception or without knowing their or my STI status. I guess I used(and still do) it as a coping mechanism or form of self harm in a way. 

My ex was always very responsible in this area and preferred to use condoms. However we did end up having a lot of unprotected sex throughout the relationship as I had told them that I wasn‚Äôt worried about contraception etc as I‚Äôd only ever had unprotected sex in the past and nothing bad had happened. I had convinced myself that I couldn‚Äôt get pregnant because of my long history with anorexia and had either no period or very irregular periods for many years. I had also never had an STI but hadn‚Äôt been checked in a while. I know this was very irresponsible of me and I feel extremely guilty over it as I could have put my ex‚Äôs health at risk. My ex persuaded me to get tested a few months into the relationship and thankfully I was all clear.

However, nearly a year into the relationship I fell pregnant. Again, I feel so terrible because I feel it was my fault that we had unprotected sex, as I was the reckless one and my ex was always very cautious about using protection. I feel like I (unintentionally) misled them that everything would be ok, because I was/am stupid and impulsive and reckless.

Anyway after about a month since finding out I was pregnant I decided to have an abortion. I was having a lot of mixed feelings at the time and went through a period of regret but I put this down to the hormones, because I knew deep down I didn‚Äôt want a kid(I have never wanted kids) and realized it was the right decision. 

I was prescribed birth control, which I had always been fearful to take because of my intense fear of weight gain due to my anorexia(I had read that can cause weight gain) and also because I have health OCD and was terrified it would cause me to get a blood clot and have a stroke(I read that BC can increase this risk). However I did start taking it. 

Our relationship kind of started going down hill around this time, I had started a new job as an exotic dancer, which I loved and was beginning to lose interest in the relationship, but I was very much in denial about it at the time. 
I hardly ever wanted to have sex anymore with my then partner which was obvs very upsetting and hurtful to them. And I feel  kind of bad and anxious to say this but I feel like every time we had sex wasn‚Äôt entirely consensual, as I was very disinterested but I feel like my partner kept pestering me for it even though I obviously didn‚Äôt want to. 

But this is one of the things that has me riddled with guilt and suicidal, after a while I was only sporadically taking my birth control, as well as the fears I described previously, I guess I just didn‚Äôt really care about taking it? I didn‚Äôt even want to be having sex with my partner, but I didn‚Äôt tell them I wasn‚Äôt taking it properly. And I guess I was still being my reckless impulsive self, not caring what happened to me etc. My memory is very hazey from around this time, I was going through a lot, had had another suicide attempt around this time and had spent some time in the psych ward. I am now wracking my brain trying to remember exactly what happened and it‚Äôs driving me crazy. I can‚Äôt remember exactly how often I wasn‚Äôt taking the pill. but there was a couple of times that I just went out and bought the morning after pill when I thought there was an increased risk of getting pregnant. For example one night my partner came inside me, I didn‚Äôt take my prescribed pill in the morning(just told my partner I forgot) but did go out and buy the morning after pill. I don‚Äôt know why I have less anxiety about taking that than the regular pill but anyway. 

So here I am a year later in the psych ward again and here‚Äôs why: A few days ago I came across a post on Instagram about ‚ÄúRape by deceit‚Äù which said sex cannot be consensual if you do something such as lying about your STI status or lying that you‚Äôre on birth control when you‚Äôre not. Well, my world came crashing down around me. I am now convinced that this is what I have done and I cannot live with myself because of it. I feel like a disgusting monster, I don‚Äôt see any way out except to kill my self, I have convinced the hospital to discharge me tomorrow so I can do it. I have everything planned",suicide

58242,"Time to SuicideI've been anxious since I was 4. Bullied badly all through school. Couldn't make proper friends because I distrusted everybody. Lived in fight or flight ever since. Home was tense too, distant volatile father, gentle mother, they broke up thank god but by then the damage was done. Flunked my Leaving Cert, worked in sales and got addicted to spending cash I didn't have, smoking joints to numb the pain even though it actually made me more anxious and always tired.

I stayed in unhappy relationships ignoring my gut because frankly I didn't know how I felt bar constant fear. One lead to pregnancy lead to breakup lead to awful eight year custody battle including international abduction, huge legal bills and endless anxiety, heavy drinking and sleepless nights and anger. 

More relationships and then finally a breakdown and time off work. Went to counseling on and off for the years leading up to it and then went again during the time off. Met a lovely calm driven girl and got back on my feet. Job ground me slowly down and still court battles and gf seemed cold distant and sometimes v angry. Ploughed on and wanted to move in cos housemate was v moody. Battle eased off and now? She's pregnant and I nearly killed myself. 

I went to hospital for psych assessments and prescribed meds. Still want to die. 15 weeks pregnant and I just wish she'd miscarry. Awful tension in the house and she thinks I'm selfish for feeling suicidal. She knew I didn't want kids and she took laxatives that counteracted the pill and refused point blank getting an abortion.

I hate myself for feeling thus way and I hate that once again I've created a situation purely cos I was too fucked up to know if I was happy or sad. I still wish to god she'd miscarry. She's 36 and it could still happen. But I can't go through the battle again I just can't. And I can't love a girl who hates showing affection. Hates hugs or holding hands. And I can't live with myself for ruining her. I'm done. I just want a painless way to go. I'm looking up ways online but it's hard to find.",suicide

Every so often, I tell myself ""It's finally time to kill yourself. Just do it. You have nothing to lose anyways."" And guess what? I've always been too scared to do it. I never completely realized how scared I was until today. I tried doing it for like the 5th time this month, and I just couldn't bring myself to actually do it. I just sat there, cried, and went to class. You know, something as simple as hurting yourself to the point where you stop breathing shouldn't be this difficult. Its hard to heal from wounds, so wouldn't it be easier to inflict them? I always start trying, but I never even come close to dying. I'm just a pussy.

But, for a guy who's so upset about being alive, I am surprisingly spoiled. I get so many things I don't deserve. Good friends, a good family, food to go in my stomach, clean air to breath, material objects. My family in particular upsets me the most. They love me so much, and if I die it would crush them. Every time I try another suicide attempt I imagine how they'd react, what would happen if they found my body, and everything after that. Whenever this happens, I always just pause and get sad. But they only love me because they have that, its what families are supposed to do, even though I don't deserve there love, respect, or kindness. The fact I'm so spoiled, and selfish just makes me wanna end my life even more. There are some perfectly sweet and more deserving poor people in the world that deserve everything I have for more than me? Why don't they have it? I should be the one starving, I should be the one suffering. I really don't deserve to be happy.

I'm just so tired of being me. I'm tired of being lazy, stupid, making mistakes, being the butt of every joke, being the first world's personal punching bag, always being considered just another teenager addicted to his phone, always being seen as just some dumbass that can't get good grades or make anything out of his life. I'm tired of going insane, constantly thinking about hurting others because of my problems, seeing my morality, my former love for others, and everything that used to be good about me, just deteriorate. I'm so sick of being such a shadow of my former self. If five year old me could see me know, he'd be so disappointed he ends up becoming such a selfish, narcissistic, worthless, meaningless, talentless slob that everyone on the planet has made their doormat and punching bag.

Ever since I was 14 I have been battling depression, I didn't realize that I wasn't as happy as everyone else and that occasional suicidal thoughts were not normal until I was 17. About six months after an initial visit to a psychologist (when I found out that my mentality wasn't the norm) and convincing myself that I was fine and didn't need help, my significant other of 2 years left me. It sent me into a downward spiral and into feeling isolated and lonely and led to a suicide attempt. I was taken to a hospital and prescribed antidepressants. After that everything started to get much better, I began regularly seeing a therapist and taking my meds until I felt stable and that my therapist wasn't helping anymore. I continued taking meds but no longer saw my psychologist and I met a new girlfriend. That was about 2 years ago.

The new girlfriend and I fell very deeply for each other, both of us thinking we could make it the long run, marriage and family and all. Everything was fantastic for our first year, but then I began to sabotage our relationship. I would pick fights over insignificant things, begin to try to control way too many aspects of her life, I even got violent with her once. I didn't understand what was happening. This cycle of me getting upset over tiny things, her apologizing, and us having one or two days of peace before I found something else to be mad at continued for about a month or two.

This last week however, she called me after work and she told me that she wanted to end things. To me it was sudden, we were talking about living together and how exciting that was two days prior. But in the grand scheme of things I could see where she was coming from, we were fighting a lot. That night I convinced her to have it just be a break until this Thursday. It was obvious that I was really hurting her.

Since then it has been a huge wake up call for me and I have been doing a lot of introspective thinking. And I came to realization of me sabotaging everything and always blaming her for making me upset. This has sent me into a horrible downward spiral. I don't think I've ever been this depressed. I called a new therapist to set up an appointment for next week, but it's finals week for me (Junior in college) and I cant focus, or study. Time is going by incredibly slowly.

I don't know what to do. I want to be with her so badly, she was my best friend, (blah blah blah classic I loved her thing), but at the same time I can't stop thinking that she deserves better, or that she left me because of someone else, etc. I'm going down a really dark path again, I started having suicidal thoughts and I began cutting myself again, this time worse than ever. I just feel so lost and pathetic for not even being able to make it a week without her before falling to pieces.

For the sake of this long ass post, I'll stop it there",suicide

I feel like I'm just... not a functioning human. Not in the sense of having some disability or something that's outside my control, I'm just fundamentally not good at this shit.

I'm 30 and still living at home in a house full of fucked up relationships and fighting. I've never been able to hold down a job for more than a couple of years without getting emotionally overwhelmed and quitting, with long stretches of sedentary basement-dwelling in between. I completed a useless degree but only barely and by the time I finished, my confidence and my dreams of taking my education further had taken a shot to the knee. I have just quit my third job ever because I was having suicidal urges at work, and am trying to muster up the energy to finish my two weeks' notice, which is necessary to pay for some dental work I desperately need. I'm already late going in as I type this post.

In some ways, things seemed to be getting better. We're mostly financially stable, so I don't have to worry about consequences like ending up on the street, at least not right now. I'm trying various antidepressants, I'm in therapy, I got my first boyfriend through online dating, etc.. But getting so overwhelmed that I had to quit this job (the best one I've ever managed to land, working in electronics at a big-box store) has me questioning whether I'll ever be able to just... support myself and exist without leeching off my mother, like a normal human. She's given up everything for us and we've been ungrateful, worthless, irritating burdens at every turn. I'm scared of my boyfriend realizing how messed up I really am, I'm scared of my mom dying and leaving us all fighting to stay afloat, and I'm scared of living the next 50 or so years with nothing but drudgery and grinding away at a retail job to look forward to. I want to try to establish a writing career so I never have to go back to the hell that is retail again, but if I don't make it, I don't know how to face the rest of my life.

263775,"Physical pain turning psychologicalI've been in the hospital for over a month total throughout this year. Colitis, intestinal perforation, return of the intestinal perforation after 3 months with an abdominal drain, and now this...

Got calm and relaxed (and okay, tipsy) by my fire pit a couple weeks ago, and fell asleep. Big mistake. A log that was sticking up out of the pit burned enough to split and fall and catch my pants leg on fire. I woke up to the lower half of my leg on fire. Terrifying. By the time I got my pants off and screamed for help, my partner came to help me inside and as he was removing my sock, he found it melted to my skin. Rest of my leg was CHARRED. 

He took me to the ER which rushed me to a burn unit a couple hours away by ambulance. I had a skin graft and stayed there a couple nights. Was sent home and am to return in a few more days to get the dressing off and plan my next skin graft (they said it would take at least 2). 

I also have a colonoscopy scheduled for December 29 to ascertain how much of my lower intestine will need to be removed bc I will need a resection at the beginning of the year. 

I am in constant pain because of one or the other. Years before this I had been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, ADHD (primarily inattentive), Chronic Major Depression, Seasonal Affective Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I have been hospitalized for a suicide attempt 20 years ago. 

I feel like I'm losing my mind, y'all. I can't tell what's real and what's not. My brain is trying to kill me, telling me I'm a burden and I'm worthless and everyone would be better without me. 

Strangers telling me that's not true won't help. But I know I NEED help. I'm writing this to ask anyone who might know WHERE do I go? I don't have money or insurance. Should I ask my parents to have me involuntary committed? They offered. Is that what's best? Should I return to the burn center and tell them I'm having suicidal ideations and I don't think I can trust myself to be alone? Where should I go, what should I do? Right at this moment I don't want to die but these moments are becoming more fleeting and it's becoming harder not to give in to the part of me that says the pain would be over if I just shot myself in the head outside in the woods where my family wouldn't have to clean up the mess and they would probably just be relieved that I'm not a burden to everyone anymore. 

Please tell me where I can find help. I have two children who lost their father 4 years ago when they were just 8 and 11. I can't orphan them and I'm so scared that's what I'm going to do soon if I don't find help.

I‚Äôm not scared of failing the exam, I know I‚Äôll be okay at that..my problem comes from my own mistake I made in 2017. I was pulled over and arrested for running a stop sign with a blood alcohol level of 0.09 (0.01 above the legal limit). I always roll through stop signs, it‚Äôs a bad habit I have always had; especially when it‚Äôs an empty intersection with no headlights in sight. But this time it cost me severely. It took everything in my power not to end it all the day I got out on a personal bond because that was my first offense ever and I thought my future was over, but I was told everything will be okay. Everything will work out. Eventually, things did. I *thought* I got the record expunged after the original charge was dropped to a traffic ticket, I graduated college, and I landed my dream job. However, just recently I reached out to my state board to ask why it‚Äôs taking so long to get my approval to test to take my board exam and continue what I have worked so hard for. What they told me literally made my heart sink to my stomach. They told me that they would send me my eligibility status within 30 days because I was originally supposed to receive it earlier this month, but ‚Äúsomething from 2017‚Äù popped up...those words have been running through my mind all day and night for what seems like forever. I‚Äôve done two background/criminal checks on myself and each time MY record came back negative with 0 hits, and the only thing that popped up was my father‚Äôs extensive criminal record; the most recent one happening in 2017. Could his criminal record be causing what‚Äôs taking so long to get my approval since we share the same last name? Can the state board see my expunged case? If I‚Äôm not eligible to test, I literally wasted 4 years of my life and I don‚Äôt see a point to even try anymore. One stupid mistake can possibly ruin my entire life. At this point, I‚Äôm trying to remain hopeful, but it‚Äôs just so hard. If I get news that the state deems me ineligible...I have wasted my entire collegiate career and disappointed my family and loved ones. The anxiety waiting for the approval is killing me, and for now, I will remain hopeful. But if I receive news that I am ineligible..that will probably be the final push I need.",suicide

No matter what I did , friends I made or places I went the happiness was always fleeting. I wanted to die. I felt like I had no purpose no meaning to my life. I started heavily drinking with people who weren't even friends. I just wanted to drink to the point I couldn't wake up. Eventually I broke down when I was about 17 in the doctors office when they asked me if I had been feeling depressed. Ended up being diagnosed with chronic depression. I've been on medication the past 4 years and I'm turning 21 soon. these feeling I have haven't gone away the medicine helps but the thought of killing myself one day is almost a comfort.

Sorry for the lenght and my english, it's not my first language.
I need your help in writing a suicide note. Soothing and uplifting as much as possible. I'm not sure if i want to go through with killing myself, but even if i don't it would help to know how to have an honest and least hurting talk with my family.

I'm a long time lurker here on SW and reddit in general, but i can't seem to find a testimonials of surviving members of a person who commited suicide. I would love if you could direct me to such threads if you remember them.

I was weird and depressed since i can remember. I was a toddler philosophing away on a sense of living and nature of cosmos and religion. 
I never felt a need to go on. I was always flabbergasted by people's drive to live. Since i was ten, every year blowing candles on my birthday cake I wished to die, to have brain tumour or something. 

I tried to kill myself 8 years ago with no success. No one knows about it.
I tried to live and work on myself since then, for all those years until now, I tried everything - psychiatrist, drugs, self-help books (I mastered them), soothing arts and crafts, sports (I'm so fucking fit now), alcohol, comedy, music, films, cheerful friends, various consuming jobs, witnessing miracles of nature and so on. I feel like I'm living behind a glass tank. 

Nothing can change my mind.

So I ask you now - all you normal sensible people - If I wrote that I tried to kill myself 8 years ago and that since then I REALLY tried to continue living just for Your well being - would it be a little comforting?

If I explained that I was struggling with a disease that I researched on for years and couldn't find a cure, would you feel less guilty for not knowing about my sick state all along? 
I never confided in anyone, I didn't want to burden them with my fucked up problems. 

The well being of my loved ones is really important to me. As far as I know there's not even a real medical, physical proof of depression, so just please help me comfort my family.

I'll be grateful for every insight and thoughts.
Thanks for your time and effort.

then continued to watch the movie and i may have shed a tear because i was having a bad day and i didn't speak to both of them for a week or two,

then i wanted to end the war so i wrote a treaty, i wrote it with a good hand writing, 

the only thing he had to do is pay me 1‚Ç¨ for all the damege he did to my hair and apologise and say that i won the war, 

when i showed him the treaty he took it and through it in the garbage and his argument was that he won and i had to pay him for a new bottle of shampoo that was 12‚Ç¨ because he used it all i didn't agree,

Learned not to stick up for myself or say a thing because I got in trouble either way... even got kicked out of church. I had pretty much no social skills. I was known for keeping my parents together and everyone was jealous of me. Little did everyone know I came home to fights everyday and spent most of my time alone with suicidal thoughts. I fantasized about my family dying and never told anyone what was going on. Im emotionally unavailable. Most of my friends have been shit because I thought I couldn‚Äôt have a friend who was considered normal. Always hung out with the partiers and troubled kids. I‚Äôve always been very hyper and impulsive and like to have fun. I hate rejection.

Started dating a narc who raped me and paid me money to stay with him after abusing me. I punched him in the face and he stalked me for months. I ran out of money for nursing school and got a factory job. Fell in love with a newly divorced man who was just like me. We loved to drink and laugh and have fun. We would get in pretty bad drunk fights and he started taking his problems out on me. I gave that guy everything. It was the happiest I‚Äôve ever been. I moved in with him and got away from my abusive parents. He was in money trouble and kept finding reasons his family and I didn‚Äôt love him and I stopped him from committing suicide.

69257,"I feel so broken‚ÄãFriday night, I went into my garage to smoke cigarettes and drink a beer. I was feeling really down. I called a suicide hotline. I wasn't about to commit suicide, but I was definitely thinking about it. You can see my other posts to get more background.

I called and talked to this hotline for 45 minutes. I was crying and unloading my problems to the poor woman on the other end. I told her that my chosen method would be by firearm because I live in a house with firearms. As I was talking to her, my mom came out into the garage to see how I was doing. My parents are both aware of how I feel and are very supportive. I told the hotline worker that I had to go and said goodbye very quickly.

I spoke with my mom and my dad. I was about to go inside with them when I got a call from my local 911 dispatch. They said that they had gotten a call from this hotline and they were sending officers for a welfare check. I was told to wait outside.

I was outside, feeling a little better that I got to talk to someone but obviously stressing about the cops coming. When they pulled up, it was two squad cars. They both shined their spotlights on me and got out of their cars quicky. The three officers didn't have their guns drawn, but they had their hands on their holsters. I instinctively put my hands up to show that I wasn't a threat.

They came up to me in my driveway and asked if I had any weapons on me or in the garage. They frisked me and checked in the garage for weapons too. They were very polite and professional, but it still made me feel like a criminal. After that, two officers went inside to talk with my parents and one stayed outside with me. Once the two came back out, they told me what was going to happen. I could either willingly go to the hospital for a evaluation or they could take me into protective custody and they would bring me. Obviously, I chose to go willingly with my mom. 

We go to the ER. I get checked in and they check my vitals. I am given a drug test and a blood test. I am completely sober. I don't do drugs and I had one beer that night. I am then brought to a ""safe room."" This room is locked from the outside. It has a bed, a TV, and a chair in it. That's‚Äã it. They take my clothes and I am given a gown‚Äã to put on. I can't even keep my phone on me. Now I have to sit in this room and wait for the on call crisis worker to show up.

I sit in this room until 3am when the crisis worker shows up. She comes in and begins to ask me the standard list of questions about my illness. She then determined that I could be discharged since I am already receiving treatment.

I finally get home at 4 am and promptly throw up in my front yard from the stress.

Everybody was professional and polite during this whole episode, but it still makes me feel like a criminal and absolutely broken as a person. I honestly felt worse by the end of the night than when I had called the hotline. Even though I was determined to not be an immediate danger to myself, I was still treated as such for 5 hours beforehand. The bed had fucking tie down points on it. They took my clothes and made me put on a striped gown. I didn't even go into how severe my depression is right now.

I'm not a cheater in that I don't flirt with other women, knowingly anyway, and in the literal meaning too. But, I get aroused pretty easily, and I used to masturbate a whole lot. She didn't like me watching porn as much as I did, makes her insecurities surge way high. So after messing up numerous times, I finally got better at it... cutting down from what was daily a few times, to maybe a few times a month. But it literally hurts me to do so. I need serious therapy, I just can't afford it. I also quit porn mostly. I'll get to that in a second.

So she has a history of being suicidal. So many times I've helped her. So many times. I've tried to leave her because of that pressure. We don't live together, and I dont have the best paying job so it gets hard since she also doesnt live in the same city as me. 

So I watched caligula last week, not knowing it was going to be a porn movie. And I did what I usually did. It wasn't planned out, but yeah, it counts. I messed up. 

Shes in Japan right now. I told her I did it. She feels suicidal now, and once again I'm in this situation where she is claiming to do it. Her favorite pet, which she loved very much, died while she was over there the first week she was there and she's been suicidal over that to, but she calmed down a lot. Now shes coupling that with the fact that I did this to her again. So, needless to say I'm afraid. She said I have till the morning (her time japan) till she says she wont give me a chance, which i feel will be followed by her trying to hurt herself, and worse. I need advice on what I can do soon... really soon.

I understand how it is, but as of right now, I just don't want her to die. Thats all I'm talking about.

As this was happening my parents put killed my lover as they said he was now ""tainted"". When I found out I went to bed crying and woke up crying. And to put the cherry on the fucking top my little bitch of a sister told everyone in my school about this. I'm so depressed and alone now I skip school and go under a bridge cry, contemplate my own death and throw rocks at stray cats. I think I'm going to go out through hypothermia, I heard the last moments are absolutely euphoric.

301133,"Whenever I seriously consider the fact that my life/childhood isn‚Äôt any worse than average person‚Äôs, I experience intense, almost intolerable, shame and psychic pain. This is deeply disturbing to me and I promise I‚Äôm not proud of it at all but I for some reason I feel like I NEED to prove to myself and to believe that I have suffered more than most people. I know this is a major victim mentality and not to people who actually suffered and it‚Äôs just a horrible thing to want but that‚Äôs part of what I feel so deeply ashamed about. Self pity is the worst. I genuinely don‚Äôt want to want it if that makes sense? 

At the same time, shocking myself into reality and self-awareness, as I try to do often, by practicing gratitude and putting things into perspective elicits hugely painful and intense feelings of rage (and self-rage) and shame that make me want to hurt myself for being so awful. 

It‚Äôs mostly shame about accepting myself as the cause of most of my problems. In theory I truly believe that and think it‚Äôs a wonderful thing to believe and act on, because it means you have control over your life. But in reality when I begin to believe that, I can‚Äôt stand to accept it, it‚Äôs so incredibly embarrassing because I have so many mental weakness and am so miserable, knowing it‚Äôs my own doing, I just... every bone in my body feels repulsed by that. 

When I read online or in books about people taking control of their life they seem to do it so gracefully. As though they have this epiphany which liberated them, but they do not talk about the crushing guilt and shame and anger towards the self that naturally accompanies that self-awareness. All the frustration and pain I‚Äôve ever felt is instantly just turned inward. An acute awareness of your worst and most despised characteristics. All of the things you aren‚Äôt happy about ‚Äî your fault. Your fault. Your fault. Your fault.",non-suicide
1068,"Yesterday I was talked out of suicide by my ex-boyfriend.I don't really know what to say here, I just feel like I need to get all this off of my chest. For the past couple of years thoughts of self harm and suicide have come and gone, even when I was in a really great place in life. Recently(the past few months) things have gotten worse for me. Multiple factors are piling up and it's starting to feel like it's entirely too much to handle. This past weekend I stayed at my ex's house and tonight when I got home something just changed, got worse somehow, and I just wanted to end it. I was actually going to do it. For some reason though, I spoke to him and he talked me out of it before he had to go to bed(he has school today), he wants me to get help but I can't afford to get any. He told me that he might ""turn me in"" which I think means tell someone at his school or the police or something about what I've been thinking of. I told him I'd never forgive him, and I can't handle my parents reactions if he did tell someone, but deep down I would give anything to have some help. I've told him for over a year now that I need help and I think he's just now starting to believe me. He told me he will get me help no matter what, but I'm so afraid of some authority figure finding out what I've been thinking of doing. I can't even talk to anyone face to face about it. I can barely talk to anybody about anything face to face. I'm not sure if I have social anxiety(the talking to people/being around people part), depression, both, or neither but I'm sure that I'm sick of my life being this way. I'm sick of existing and not living. I found this subreddit through MMFB(which I found through IAMA), and I just had to let it out somewhere where my face was unknown. I don't know if you've read this far, but if you have thank you. If you care for me to, I can try to keep this updated.

I've got the noose setup in my basement I'll be alone for the next 2-3 days if I do it tonight or tomorrow anytime, a friend will probably be the first one to find me so I'm leaving  a note to not come in. Just wondering if getting really drunk or high will help me get over the fear of the noose, i tested it just by pulling with one hand the other day and after about 4 seconds everything started to get red, I panicked and took it off but still felt like fainting for a couple seconds afterwards. Theres no doubting the lethality just doubting my willpower to make it happen, I really do want to be with my family and friends but my schizophrenia/pyschosis is too much for everyone to handle. Even me.
I've got enough whiskey on its own to make me black out if i just stand on the chair and drink, plus a months worh of anti-depressants and an almost full bottle of tylenol.
I hope theres an afterlife, If there is I'll see my father and uncle again, if not I guess I'll just be a tragic hero kind of death to everyone i know. I know my friends will never forget me, if anytjing I'll be immortal to them, in the new Ultimate Smash (my names Lucas) but I'll be jealous of them for eternity, amazing successful, loved, individuals, without mental illness, they're gonna have kids one day and shit. That sounds nice but not realistic for me anymore, if i dont do it tonight I might go to a sperm bank tomorrow just for the sake of making my mom hopeful that there's still some form of me in this world somewhere, if not I'm sure that when my sister is older she'll name a kid after me or one of my friends will or something. I used to make so many jokes about suicide that people thought i was serious, guess they were right lol. One moment you're here and then the next you're gone or your will to live is. I predicted a death like this when i was 14 despite never being depressed as a kid.

If you're around the age of  10-14 I reccommend listening to the album ""Tommy"" by The Who in the dark with a candle burning, you will see your entire future. (No drugs or alcohol necessary lol)

If you have dreams of being famous one day, wait till you're actually famous to start doing drugs. I'm a fucking idiot lol. Man i had a great life, and then drugs just fucked everything up, and i had multiple times where I said I probably shouldn't do drugs anymore but kept going, I'm sorry dad I failed you, hopefully I'll see you soon and we can listen to Eric Clapton in heaven or some shit. You'd almost think the death of a loved one would make you think smarter about life but fuck I guess not me.

TL:DR Sorry about all the random crap, just need some help with the hanging thing really. Will getting really high or drunk make it easier/ less painful? I'd appreciate the advice.

89377,"My friend [30M] is severely depressed and set on killing himself by the end of the month.First of all, sorry for the x-post. I realized /r/suicidewatch is a more appropriate subreddit to post this on. 

I've met this friend 5 years ago on forum aimed at people with depression. We were pretty close during the first couple of years, but we gradually drift apart after I started Uni. Not only that but he also got absorbed into some relationships and would barely remember to call me. Nowadays, we don't speak to each other nearly as frequently as we used to in the first years. However, we still call each other once in a while and talk like nothing has happened.

I'm the only friend he has at this moment since he's distanced himself from everyone else. I'm like family to him, I think. Also worth mentioning that he's from a different state than mine.

My friend has had problems with girls since I met him. Really bad problems. He'd been obsessed with one for 10 years, but managed to recover with medication and such. He's had other relationships with girls he claims he never truly liked. When he does like someone, it usually involves a lot of drama.

One year ago, he met someone [21F] who was part of the same community where I had met him. She has trust issues and borderline personality disorder. It wasn't long until they started to like each other, exchange pictures, make plans for their future and whatnot. However, she'd had a few bad experiences with a stalker boyfriend in the past and the trauma wouldn't allow her to give personal information away such as phone number, address, full name, etc (yet she planned to move in with him at some point...). Their contact was limited to fake VK profiles and alternative email accounts. She didn't like talking on the phone either as she wasn't able to call for a pizza. On the other hand, she was doing well in college and had a really nice family backing her up.

My friend has been depressed for most of his life. It seems that having someone with him helps him cope and gives him things to look forward to. Unfortunately it's the only thing that makes him want to keep on living. The same thing he thinks will save him is also what damages him the most. I think it may be a distraction, it's almost as though he's trying to escape from his problems. He's been trapped in this cycle for years and has done very little to change the things that he doesn't like about his life.

Their online and exclusively text-based relationship lasted for 6 months, I think. He was starting to get impatient with all that, thinking maybe she didn't really like him as she claimed. He then decided to break up with her. She was very understanding. She said that with all her problems, it'd definitely be for the best. My friend even tried another relationship with someone from the same community at the time (didn't work as he kept comparing the two of them).

Although this girl that he liked seemed to be OK with it, she was actually suffering a lot and he hadn't picked up on that in time. One day, without a warning, she deleted herself and he's never heard of her again since.

For the last 6 months, he's been feeling very guilty and severely depressed. Keeps saying he messed up his only chance at a relationship. That he regrets not being more patient or understanding and that if he had waited longer, she might have given him consistent ways to contact her. He is thinking of killing himself over that. Wel, not only that but also because he claims he's never going to find someone like her and who also likes him back. He's even contracted a detective from her state to look for her so he could talk to her again.

More importantly, he's going to kill himself if the detective can't find her until the end of this month. He still has the gun he's bought 6 to 7 years ago. He claims that he can't even work because he keeps thinking about it. I've been trying to speak to him and for the last two months and all he wants to talk about is this. He keeps sending me screenshots of their conversations expecting me to explain why she did this. He couldn't work for his family anymore since he was so depressed he had to leave to cry in the bathroom. In all the 5 years I've known him, I've never seen him feeling this bad before.

I tried to talk to him about this many times. I've already exhausted all my arguments. I tried to counter his words objectively, but instead of hearing me he chooses to find small faults in my arguments. For instance, I told him ""look, you've been repeating this pattern for years now"", to which he replied ""...but I've only known her for a year"". He's put her on a pedestal and thinks there will never be anyone like her (pretty, young, likes the same things, etc). I told him that no one is irreplaceable unless he decides so, but that and many other common sense knowledge things fell on deaf years.

What else could I possibly say? I told him to go back on therapy and maybe try out a new psychiatrist, but he says he's not going to do that as the only thing that would help him will never happen again (that is, finding someone like her). I think he's been having delusions as he once asked me if I knew of a way to erase someone's memory. I'm really worried for him and nothing that I say seems to have any effect. I have depression myself so I'm not the most positive person to say ""hey, there's much to live for yet"". I thought I'd try to contact his mother and tell her he needs to get hospitalized, but I'm afraid he's going to hate me for that.

Plus, this is a very difficult decision for me as someone who also struggles with depression, I keep thinking ""who am I to deny him that?"". I'm going to miss him, surely. I don't want him to kill himself, of course. But I keep thinking if that wouldn't be selfish on my part if he's really suffering that much. Damn, I am clueless. :(

38142,"Pushed away the girl I loved. She was the only person that made me happy. Since then, it‚Äôs been a downhill. My weight makes anything near impossible. I‚Äôm put down everyday, I‚Äôm just struggling with life.Hello, I‚Äôm a long time lurker here, and after an argument I just had with my mom, I feel I need to share my story and convey my emotions. It‚Äôs gonna be a long one, sorry. Thank you to anyone who does infact take the time to read my story. 

I‚Äôm going to start by saying I‚Äôm 18 years old and have been battling depression for the past 2ish years. I‚Äôm a pretty big guy for my age (18st, about 250lb). I grew up independently cooking for myself and being young obviously cooking meals for myself which just weren‚Äôt healthy at all in large portion sizes, which have lead to me being the weight I am now. I remember the days in school when I used to run 1000m and enjoy all types of sports and now I can‚Äôt do any of that at all. Towards my GCSEs in school was when the depression started, I had ‚Äòfriends‚Äô who would bully me, make jokes about my weight, thinking I was okay with it, I wasn‚Äôt. It hurt inside. 

I started skipping school and sleeping a lot, that was my life for a good while. However, I started speaking to a girl in my year, still not sure how that happened; maybe she just felt bad for me. We were just friends, but spoke to each other everyday. We‚Äôd FaceTime each other for hours and just talk, watch films together, anything really. This was the first girl who‚Äôd actually taken the time with me and the first person I‚Äôd ever really spoken to about personal things, like my relationship with my dad. I ended up falling in love with this girl because of how she treated me, the only issue... she liked my friend. She‚Äôd speak about him when we was on the phone together, and I was jealous. I could never say anything though, we were just friends in her eyes. As much as I loved this girl and how she listened to me, I couldn‚Äôt tell her how I felt and ended up pushing her away, the biggest mistake of my life... She was the one person in life who made me happy and I ruined that. 

This happened a week after I finished school ready to start the next venture of my life. I had the whole summer to enjoy myself but began to just stay in, isolate myself and eat. I did this for 6 weeks. It was coming to the end of summer and I had to apply somewhere, whether that be a job, an apprenticeship or college. I waited until the very last minute and then joined college. In all fairness, college was great. I met a bunch of new friends who I related to and enjoyed my time, but the stress of assignments due in quickly added to my depression. I finally spoke to a new friend who had faced depression in the past about how I was feeling, who convinced me to speak to someone. I spoke to a mental health nurse who was supposedly helping me. She‚Äôd speak to me over the phone for like 10 minutes asking how I was each week and had booked me in for a session with a therapist, the only thing being there was a huge wait, like 4 months to see one, so she advised I‚Äôd be put on anti-depressants. I was on 10mg of Citalopram for 4 months. I feel these were good for me, I felt good and they were helping especially with the stress of college. I was able to finish my college course with a pass and enjoyed myself over the summer, it was a good time. 

I have now started my second year at college, being unable to find a job or an apprenticeship, being rejected at every chance I saw, this was my option for the year. I decided by myself I should come off my Citalopram and did so without consulting anyone. This was a bad decision. Everything was fine for a week or so and then everything started coming back. I feel depressed again and I‚Äôm stressing out over little things. 

My weight doesn‚Äôt help either. I have to catch a bus into the city where my college is, which takes like 20 minutes and then a 10 minute walk. This is fine, but whatever I am wearing and whatever the weather, I sweat abnormally either due to my weight or some issue that I don‚Äôt know of yet. It‚Äôs the most embarrassing and uncomfortable thing, I constantly feel like crap turning up to college or just walking around and being sweaty. I could try and lose the weight but through my depression, I‚Äôm just not motivated even though I know I need to lose this weight. 

The depression has gotten to the point where I‚Äôm now experiencing suicidal thoughts. I can‚Äôt live with how unhealthy I am. It kills me everyday. I need a solution which is ultimately to lose weight but I just can‚Äôt... I honestly feel like I‚Äôm going to kill myself soon either by eating myself to death, or actual suicide because of this. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I thank you for reading my post, didn‚Äôt really know what to write or how to write and lay it out, but however jumbled up my post is, it was good to write this for my sake, as someone that rarely speaks about their issues. 

I‚Äôd also like to thank everyone hear that offers their voice and helps out people that post their feelings here everyday whilst I am hear. It‚Äôs definitely helped me sometime looking at posts and seeing how people help each other. Thank you.

There was a point in my life where I really wanted to die. 

Now, I can't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I live a relatively privileged life. My family is kind, I have good friends, I go to a privileged school. I get to do and see things that many don't see in a lifetime. The world around me is beautiful. But I don't feel worthy of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I started feeling like I wanted to die. No idea why. I'm not clinically depressed. I have no mental illnesses that I know of. I just hated my soul. Not myself. I hated the being I had created. I was in pain. I am a very appreciative person. And that has become my downfall. I appreciate the world around me so much that I have diminished myself as a human being. I love everything. And I hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to die.

&amp;#x200B;

This feeling continued for a long time. But now I have reached a point where I realized that I am not worthy of feeling sad. That I am not allowed to feel the satisfaction of feeling suicidal. Because I am privileged and I am supposed to be happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel sad, then I feel angry, then I feel depressed, then I feel suicidal, then I feel mad at myself for being suicidal, and then I want to die all over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that if I were to kill myself, I would cause so much pain to all the people around me. They would think I was selfish to do that. Do i really exist just to please other people? Am I just sticking around so that other people don't have to suffer?

I don't want to die.

Because then other people will get hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

I go up to my room and cry my eyes out for fun. Then I sit, forcing myself to smile in the dark. Because I'm not supposed to be sad. I'm too privileged to feel sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I was never born. Then I could just not exist and nobody would feel the pain of me leaving. Because I was never there in the first place. But now I'm stuck here.

159031,"Turning 20 this year and I'd like to share you guys the time my batchmates decided to catfish my 50 year old teacher. And she believed. So I graduated high school, hooray! But it was a wild Senior year for me, with all the suspensions and disciplinary reports of smoking and drinking in the halls (another fuck up) it's still a surprise that I was able to graduate as an honor student. 

But byfar the most craziest thing that ever happened in my year was that one of my classmates catfished my teacher. I don't think it's right, but I was scared with getting ostracized as a 16 year old since everyone said it was only justice for us. And any one snitching is sure to get their ass kicked for the rest of the year. 

My classmate targeted the strictest teacher who had a subject in charge for every class for the seniors. The reason why we even thought this would kinda work was because she's lonely. No kids, husband, not even a widow herself. Her relatives were mostly also her nephews who have shown to have a resentment to her, since if they didnt they'd tell immediately. 

I hated this teacher too, but as someone who lurks in online communities I think it was harsh, reading tons of catfish stories I knew what kind of potential shit she'd be in. I hate her but she was honestly a sweet lady in her office, and we'd know since we visit her office a lot. Or maybe it's because I'm an honor student, idk. 

She's one of those teachers that makes you understand how they're human too at an early age. Back to the story, they made an account and used a picture from a random guy who was in his mid 20's. Made a Facebook account and added her as a friend. 

She accepted the request and they started chatting to her. They tried flirting with her for a week and they said she didn't bother with the catfish account until a month where she decided to open up. 

And ever since then it felt like the account and her had gotten closer. It reflected to her in school too! She started doing her hair, and bought a waist trainer since the catfish guy told her about his ""type"" when she asked. 

Our school works had also gotten less extreme and difficult and she was more understanding. The sad thing about this is that I realized she just acted so harsh, not completely because she was a teacher that needs to teach the students discipline. But because she had nothing to look up to in her daily life. She really was lonely like we anticipated and not some person who had some secret deep shit about herself. Girl just needed someone to love her. 


This went on for months, and her shift in mood affected everyone in the school. Since she was in charge with internal affairs too (the workload she had was very surprising) the principal even was affected to a degree. 

Some teachers also found out but they decided not to tell, because it was too harsh and I guess everyone was too tired of her shit for years that they decided to keep the lie for everyone's sake. She was less overbearing with them too in the faculty room. 

But it all went shit when the ""guy"" asked to met her. She took on leave, and her itinerary was ready (also wondering how they'd get one) and asked for leave for the first time in 3 years. The situation got too fucked up that I also could not believe how it never went to court.

She waited for the guy but never showed up, while we cheered in the school at how she was finally blooming. (Even if we all secretly knew what actually was happening) We knew that the next day shit finally went down. Everyone was low-key preparing a support hotline and watching over her, like it was the biggest school prank that everyone agreed. (which its not) 

She didn't come to school for three days. And in those days everyone was worried, honestly I knew the guy who did it. But I was scared of getting beaten up, since his family still had that old Mafia lifestyle and control in the city. (3rd world countries am I right?) 

My teacher did go back to school and thank God it wasn't suicide. But the waist trainer and everything disappeared, and she was even more harsh. He told us that the catfish account ""broke up"" with her at the last minute like a soap opera novel. 

She was a laughing stock in the school even with how extremely aggressive she became. I remember how I crossed her office and saw her screaming at the principal, I decided not to tell everyone that she did it. 

The prank was harsh that after that year she decided to move to another school. Sure she might have problems (we can tell), but she also doesn't deserve that. Worst part was everyone in the school agreed, or was just scared of my classmate targeting them. 

I even think it's the reason why I was able to graduate as an honor because he had my back for that as a thank you for tutoring him. (Mafia right now is starting to be romanticized by shows but it's really not something that should be)

338783,"Tried to kill myself last night. Am currently stable, but no one to talk to. Scared.I have problems communicating when I'm anxious, so I can only try to make sense through bullet points:

- Had a shitty couple of years. Long story short, I had to quit school, I moved across the country without any family, I found out I'd been cheated on and had also been the cheatee without knowing it, I went five months without a job leading to my father's family essentially giving up on me ever being successful (I have a long history of being bipolar and it changed how everyone saw me since I was a pre-teen). 

- The biggest factor was that I found out the relative who sexually abused me as a child had kidnapped me as an infant and had been saying sexual things about me to my parents and mother's family's knowledge without them acting on it ever since it started. (All they don't know about is the molestation itself.) It makes me feel like I was never worth protecting.

- All of this has left me feeling incredibly abandoned by everyone in my family except my parents, and even then, I feel very alone and like I'm constantly disappointing them.

- I'm fat, lazy, ugly. I can't look in a mirror without wanting to throw up.

- I'm gay and I keep turning bi girls straight. It makes me believe ultra-religious bullshit about me being deformed. Like those girls got ""fixed"" but I can't be. I've liked girls since I was 12 and never felt ashamed like this before. I feel like a horrible person for thinking this way about myself.

- I know I can't discuss methods, but, I basically completely lost my shit and staged something to make it look like an accident.

- Best friend ran after me. Started yelling and physically pulled me away. She doesn't know what I was actually planning. She thought it was just a panic attack.

- Been having a crisis all day. Knowing how close I was.

- Scared but glad. Shocked would be a better word. Feeling numb over so many things. How I almost died/was seriously injured. How many innocent people would have watched it/been traumatized for life. How my best friend saved me without knowing and didn't get mad at me for screaming/swearing at her to leave me alone immediately after.

- Too numb and guilty to be thankful. That's why I can't talk about this to anyone I know. I probably can't for years.

- I'm relieved. Relieved that maybe this got it ""out of my system"" and relieved that I'm not regretting that I'm alive right now. Hadn't attempted to do anything like this since I was 14. Feeling like I'm going through the motions as I think about what would have happened. Who would have told my family. What my friends would be doing today.

- Feeling stupid.

224776,"I just want my life backI feel like so many things have been stolen from me. I've been abused for years and I have no idea how I'd ever break myself of having awful people in my life. I feel like I did something to deserve the way I'm treated, but it makes me want to die.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to be able to read again,play around with makeup, go hiking, write, play music, draw, paint, and trust. I have no energy to do the things I enjoyed, and when I do try, I break down because I can't stop thinking about all the horrible things that have happened recently, and forever ago. 

&amp;nbsp;

I don't remember the last time I felt truly happy or secure. And even when I did, I was being betrayed behind my back, like an idiot. I can't trust anyone, I don't have anyone. I was promised the world and left with nothing but a broken soul. I gave everything up believing that I was making an investment, and I've lost everything.

&amp;nbsp;

I've had an attempt a few times a month up until lately, now it's more like at least once a week. I wondered why I couldn't do it. I feel like I get so close, but I can't shake that instinct to live. I realized that it's because I don't want to die, I just want my life back. 
&amp;nbsp;

I guess deep down, I don't want to die, I just know that I can never be the same, so I know I have to go. I've been through too much and I'm not strong enough to keep going and continue being hurt by everyone I love. Every time I try to get back up and brush myself off, someone hurts me. Every single time, without failure. I'm hurt, then told to go to therapy and promised a better life. I go to therapy, and then when I'm doing better, someone strikes again.

&amp;nbsp;


Yet, I'm so lonely. It's easier to be around people who you know you can't trust, than to find new people and wonder when they'll hurt you. I wish that I could have someone who I could trust completely, someone who would treat me kindly and with respect, someone who would just smile at me and hold me, but I know I can't have that. Especially not now. I'm just a broken person. This ""life"" experiment was a failure, I feel like it's reasonable to call it quits at this rate.

Touches me down there (and lets me touch her boobs...). But when one of our friends say something like: you two should kiss or something similar, she inmediately refuses it and even sometimes gets annoyed with the person who said it.

 I don't want to be his boyfriend because she will leave this town in about 3 to 10 days (We don't know exactly how much) and I won't see her in about 6 months, but I want at least kiss her but I don't know how to do it because I've never done it before.

I don't doubt that there has been an abundance of ""PM me if you want to talk!"" posts/comments, but I'm making this anyway. I know how bad it feels.

A little background; I've struggled with self harm for 4 years, hospitalized on one instance, and underwent therapy for a good while. It started with tiny cuts and progressed to slicing my arm, and anywhere else, just so I could get the release, feel the rush and the pain. It was a way out. It got worse, though, when I started contemplating suicide. Even now I struggle with the thought, but I know I wouldn't do it. I didn't have the best childhood or home life, but nobodies lives are perfect. 

I am better now, however, for the most part. Despite some re-occurring thoughts and urges, I haven't self mutilated in almost a year. I've increased my standard of living, and after dealing with critically low self esteem for months, I decided it was time for a change of view, and completely turned myself around. This would not have been possible without the help of my friends and family, proving everyone does need someone.

I'm offering to be that someone, someone with insight to what you could possibly be feeling. Even if it seems like it doesn't, it does get better. If anyone needs something, I am ALWAYS available for a message, even if it's just to be confided in. I love you all, stay strong.",suicide

63217,"I'm a toxic person and can't hold on to relationshipsLittle backstory, I grew up with divorced parents, constantly talking smack about eachother and fighting over me. I ended up manipulated away from my mother (according to her), where my father had me alienated from by ""abusive"" mother. I was also convinced that I should not be taking ADHD medication which has honestly helped in terms of school and a little bit in relationships. CPS and dealing with the court system was a normal part of my childhood, but thankfully I repressed most of those memories. I was in counseling and therapy for 8 years because of this.

I had quiet, kept to myself, and had no life or friends throughout high school other than those I smoked weed with but I landed a good job doing what I loved after graduation and had lots of disposable income. I was in a relationship with the only girl I talked to in high school and was about to take her to prom, but we broke up beforehand and rekindled it after graduation. I had lots of material things but still my only friends were my pot smoking ones with some low-quality relationships here and there.

For a majority of college I was single, and had a few short-term sexual relationships and hookups. Most of those girls have me blocked now. I see it as we worked the relationship past its expiration date and it became toxic. I also experimented with LSD a few times and partied like there was no tomorrow. After all, I had a good, stable start to my goal career, a BMW and a 2019, and still lots of income for a teenager to have. Life was good.

After a couple years I decided to move away and start a new career in the military. I broke up with my girlfriend on good terms, rekindled my relationship with my mother, stopped doing drugs, and started my new life.

I thought it was off to a good start. I met new people, tried being a nicer, happier, more confident person. I started maintaining a healthier lifestyle minus the military parties and vaping. Trying to be a more positive, optimistic, and approachable person.

But the relationships I make with girls are fucking me up. It's gotten to the point where most women and people around me believe I'm a psychopath and some crazy fucked up, sickening person (I've been called these by women when it doesn't work out, and old best-friends). It's like I lose control of my emotions at a certain point in romantic relationships and become toxic, I overthink and over-analyze everything. And once the relationships is ruined I realize what I lost, and then can't explain why I acted a certain way.

I can't figure out what had actually happened. Whether they were or I was the toxic one in the relationship, but it's them breaking up or letting me down easily all the time. I feel like I can sense if I'm about to get hurt, and that I should leave the relationship but I ignore it and believe it may work out. I feel like I can sense when they fuck another guy, and it causes traumatic dreams for multiple nights. People agree and tell me that I'm falling apart but I don't see any of this.

I never felt crying because of my friends but today I am realising that the dream that we had when we 10 that we will be best friends forever and together take on the world is utter bullshit. I never felt this sad. So here has what happened.
P( I am reffering to him as this) and I have been friends as long as I remember. The thing is I cant remember time when we were not friends. He is more brother to me than my own real brother. In past two years in preparation for  college we bacame distant but we regularly called and hang out. During covid he was the only person I called . I live with my parents and all the frustration of living at home and college I talked to him. We are part of a whats app group . it has 8 of us middle school friends . we all 8 were gonna be friends for life and we were up until now. I don‚Äôt talk much in group because I am a little busy but I regularly read all the conversations and fun we have there. Lately he also has been busy with his  college papers so I am calling more often than him . he also talks more frequent in group. 

We had decided than in may we would visit a couple of places that are on the outskirts of my city . that is a palace and couple of a beautiful sites. We always wanted to go there but didn‚Äôt had the time. 
Today apparently the group decided to visit and have a reunion . they planned in the group and visited it. I saw the instagram photos and was so shocked. I opened the group and saw the planning. Every person who wanted to go was talking there. They thought I was busy and dint even called me to see. Not even him. 

The main part that hurts is that I always have been kind of forfront of this group. I was the class president,I helped every one of them . I created the group . i was the one who threw a reunion on my last birthday so that evryone can meet. 
I know this sounds cheesy but this fucking hurts. I am probably gonna quit the whole group and let them carry on. I need some positive friends in life. 
The covid has made it worse. I have been stuck in my house taking online classes and no friends because of it. If any one of you can give me something positive that would be appreciated. Thanks for reading my rant.",non-suicide
115804,"Antidepressant withdrawal is hardI don't need replies, I just need to vent. I could vent in notepad, but it feels different venting to a forum.

I'm UK-based. I spent my full 3 years with Early Intervention in Psychosis. I get depressed, then I hear voices that want me to end my life. It took a bit of tinkering, but we found that escitalopram (an antidepressant) and no antipsychotic were good for me when I'm not in a depressive episode. 

A few months ago I found myself in a heavy depressive episode. I saw my GP to refer me back to the psychiatrist's office because I couldn't cope. I'd spent my full time with EIP, so I was referred to the community mental health team, who are less well funded. Psychiatrist #1 decided that escitalopram had stopped working for me, and organised a transfer to prozac. Also, because I was struggling with the voices he gave me the only antipsychotic I tried that didn't have horrible side effects - olanzapine. It's good for me when I'm depressed enough to hear voices, but not good for normal use because it slows my mental functions. I'm a PhD student in mathematics, I need to be as sharp as possible. 

I gave prozac a couple of months, but it didn't seem to start working. Wiki says that changing antidepressant because the old one stopped working has a 70% chance of working. So psychiatrist #2 (covering for psych #1) transferred me from prozac to mirtazapine. Prozac is supposed to be one of the easiest antidepressants to come off, but for me the high half-life meant that I had the side effects for longer. Epic mood swings downwards. Brain zaps like you wouldn't believe. Shakes. 

Mirtazapine was given a fair 6 weeks to start working, and it felt like I was taking sugar pills. I was so down that the wall that olanzapine put between me and the voices crumbled down. Worse, I was obeying them when they told me to hurt myself. I've punched myself in the head until bumps form, then hit myself some more. I've cut. Psych #2 was on holiday, so I saw psych #3. He transferred me from mirtazapine to sertraline. He wanted to up my olanzapine, but I pointed out that I already feel like there's too much cotton wool in my head, and I'm sleeping ~14 hours a night.

This transfer is a cross taper. I take half dose of m and half dose of s for a week, then no m and full dose of s. Last night was my first night without m, and this morning was the first full dose of s. I'm getting withdrawal and I'm struggling to cope with the concept of carrying on until 1830 (when my partner returns from work), let alone a couple of weeks of withdrawl, and 4-6 weeks until s kicks in. If s kicks in. If s doesn't kick in then I'll have to struggle with yet another transfer. I've been transferring meds all year. I'm running out of struggle. 

The voices continue giving me hell while I struggle to do whatever coping strategies I can do. I have a barbell weight lifting routine I do, that I can't do right now because I don't have the energy. I can't read because there's too much depression and olanzapine slowing down my mental functions. I'm trying to listen to music, but instead I hear the voices enumerate the ways I could kill myself without leaving my flat. Also, I'm getting fatter because I'm struggling to motivate myself to track my calories, and my partner keeps bringing sweets home to try to cheer me up with sugar.

Also, for bad timing, I had an appointment with a psychologist this week to see if a talking therapy would be useful. He said that CBT for psychosis would be useful, but the waiting list is 8-9 months. I'm struggling with the concept of being alive in 2 hours, let alone 5700 hours.

my mom stopped with drinking for a while and now she started drinking again. i lost connection with everyone. i lost the most important person in my life. i just feel all alone and i see that everything is my fault.

319857,"My storyOk where do I start?

I've been thinking from some time now about writing on my depression problems but never went through it because it felt like this wouldn't help.

But since like every day it's around midnight and my brain is curiously not allowing me to get some much needed sleep, i have nothing better to do until i am physically exhausted enough to be able to actually sleep.

I was about to write that i did not know why i was writing about this here, anonymously online, but then it struck me: why keep this to myself? Maybe someone will read it and give me a solution I could not have thought about before?

Ok so where do i start, again? Let's try historically.

I rembember beeing a happy child. I liked school, i had good friends, my parents loved me. It was not perfect of course, but i think i was happy. That's how I recall it anyway.

Then when I was 14 my parents got separated. It was brutal. Seeing the 2 people i loved the most destroy themselves also destroyed a part of me.

One thing about this will be stuck in my head forever: when i catched my father in a bath with an electrical shaver in his hand as he was about to commit suicide and prevented him to do so. It's been 16 years since this happened but i remember it vividly. My mother told me he was just pretending and wasn't actually going to do it, but i guess i'll never know.

After this I chose to live with my father because my sister was with my mother and i did not want my father to be alone, as i was still caring for him.

He quickly found a new girlfriend who was 20 years younger than him. He first introduced her as a ""cleaning lady"" but then we quickly found out that the cleaning lady was also cleaning his ""private things"". For all i know she could have been a hooker.

She was a mean and evil person who was ready to anything to get the best out of it. Eventually it reached a point where i could not handle living like this, so i told my father about this and he made me understand that he did not care about what i felt. He did not say it literrally, but it was pretty clear and obvious.

So I got heartbroken and went to live with my mom instead.

Then time went by and it helped healing. Also i had great friends at school which also made it easier. I even made some kind of peace with my father and his girlfriend after some time.

So again, everything was not perfect, but it wasn't too bad either.

I went to college with one of my best friend and failed after 3 years because it felt i was forced to do things i did not want to do. I mean who likes doing 4 hours of hardcore maths with a boring teacher when you don't understand how it will be useful for you in the future?

Failing at college destroyed me. My best friend succeded in it, and since that time he did not care about me like he did before, so we slowly stopped beeing in touch.

I felt like my world had collapsed. I was on a train and the train derailled. I was so ashamed of my failure that i didn't want to see anyone anymore.

So I bunkered up in my room and played online video games, which were the only things which would make me feel good, alongside with junk food.

It lasted some time until both my parents had enough and forced me to go looking for a job, so i did and became an IT hotliner for an big company.

After 2 years i understood that our bosses didn't care much about us, either we worked good or not. So i was back to be forced to work on something i did not like for people i did not like either.

One day I could not bear it anymore so i just gave my resignation, knowing i had nothing else behind.

After that i went back living with my mother and her new husband for some time, until they also got fed up with me playing video games, so i had to find another job and move out.

Then same causes, same consequences. I always felt i was beeing used at my job and no matter how hard I tried or good i was, it was like no one cared anyway. I was just there because i had to, nothing more, nothing less.

After 1 year i left like i did with my first job. I found another one which is about the same story than the 2 others.

Some time passed, and then that's when I had my first severe depression event during my vacations. I felt my life was about to be forced to do things that i did not want to do and also being completely alone. So what was the point of going on if it's only pain ahead? I spent days in the dark alone, crying on my bed and wishing to die because the pain was too great.

My mom found out about this, but talking with her didn't help. We didn't know what to do about this.

So i went to see my doctor and told him i was depressed and felt like killing myself. He gave me some pills to take. To this day i'm still wondering if it wasn't just candy as it did absolutely nothing.

So i went to see a psychiatrist which required me to work on some stuff at home for my next time. I did not have the courage to tell him i was incapable of doing anything at home. Hell, I could not even take out my garbage by myself. I felt like he did not understand me, that all of this was pointless and also costly (about 60‚Ç¨ for each interview), so i stopped going there.

I still kept going to work after my vacations anyway because even if I was miserable, I felt like i had to go else it would be much worse. It might have been the instinct of survival.

So there were ups and downs, but then i reached an historical down point about a year ago. The pain was excruciating. I thought that maybe i had bad luck with the first psychiatrist, so why not try another one?

So i did, but this time i found one where i actually did not have to pay for it since my health assurance covered the price of it. So I could go there anytime i wanted without thinking that there had to be results because of the costs.

I went there thinking ""she'd better not tell me the same crap than the first one or i'm gonna kick her sorry ass"".

And yet she did! She asked me to do stuff at home for the next time. But this time i did not agreed, got a bit nervous and told her she did not understand me if she told me that because i was not able to do it.

And from there she did understand me. I went to see her regularly. I told her about the exact same things i'm writing about here and we talked about it. And finally after about 10 weeks i had an epiphany. She made me understand that life has no point in itself so the point of it is in fact to define what you want from it and go for it.

So i took a moment to think ""what do i really want in life?"". But then the problem to answer this is that there are things you want that you cannot possibly get. For example, if I want to be president of the united states, since i'm not american this will most likely by impossible anyway. So i found a way around this by thinking ""if you had a genie bottle, what would you wish for?"".

And then I made the list. And then i translated these wishes into things that i could actually get. And then i translated it to ""how do i do it?""

And then it was on. It started by wanting to loose weight to look better. So i started running and see a diet specialist. First time i went to run i ran for 5 mins and felt like i was about to die. So it was very hard. But i had a goal that was stronger than the physical pain i was enduring.

Next thing you know, 8 months later i went from fat to skinny, went to the gym so got some muscles as well and managed to run 10 kms in under 45 minutes, which i never thought i would have been able to do.

But i still didn't find me attractive and still lacked self confidence. I didn't feel healed.

One of my other goal was to get a driver licence, so i studied in hardcore mode for months. I learned everything there was to know, trained with literraly thousands of tests. I did everything humanly possible to pass this test. Yet i failed it because of 1 mistake which i knew i made and wanted to correct before the end but it was too late.

When i received the results of this exam, it felt like when i failed college all over again. The pain was too great, and so sucidal thoughts came back running.

Funny thing is, i finally went to the same exam again 2 weeks later and i passed it! But even if i was happy passing it, the damage was done and i still felt depressed.

It was the first time i actually seriously started searching a way to kill myself. *commented out talking about ways of suicide* Let's just say i don't have an easy way to do it.

I went back to my job after some vacation time but it felt even more pointless from now on. I was actually suffering at my job as well, even more than at home.

I went to work for 1 week to finish stuff only me could have done back then because i did not want to my coworkers to suffer as well because of me.

Then once i was done with it i went to see my psychatrist that stopped me from going to work for 2 weeks. It's been 1 week and a half now. I explained my bosses i was depressive and feeling my job was empty of meaning and they just answered me ""ok well get well soon"", even if i think they don't understand what's happening and they care more about me not working rather than my well beeing.

So here i am: i don't want to live, but i don't have an easy way out either. If i had a gun, i would have been long dead already. Moreover, i feel like this world stinks. It's everyone for themselves. The survival of the fittest. Success is defined by how much money you make, even if it's by beeing evil and crushing others people life with no regrets. That's how the system works.

If these people are the fittest ones, the ones that will survive, then let me out of here and let them jump at each others throats because i don't feel it's worth living for this.

But then i don't have an esay way out of this life. So i'll go back to see my psychiatrist in 3 days to see if she's able to pull another miracle out of her pocket.

I don't know if i'll keep posting here, whatever the results. Only time will tell.

Anyway if someone went this far and read all of this, i would appreciate to know what do you think/feel about it. TIA.",suicide

Yes I am thinking about killing myself.  Again.  Let's just get that out of the way.

Now, for a back story, which involves (predictably) a girl and a few regrets.

In 2003 I nearly slashed my throat with a knife.  I was a self-injurer back then.  I nearly bled to death, once.  I got it cleaned up though and nobody noticed.  That was the closest I've come to killing myself until a few years later.  This is probably what really set in motion an ongoing cycle of suicidal thoughts -&gt; almost suicide -&gt; hey things got better -&gt; things are okay -&gt; oh god what the FUCK -&gt; suicidal thoughts -&gt; again.

Over the years I've gone in and out of this cycle several times.  I am currently bouncing between ""oh god wtf"" and suicidal thoughts.

I'm going to summarize the most recent disaster quickly because I fucking hate having telling this story for the 11 millionth time.

In 2005 I met a girl - I will call her Susan - we were classmates.  It took me 2 years to work up the courage to ask her out.  She said no, of course, but I was proud of myself for trying.

We graduated in 2007 and maintained loose contact (her idea, really).

In 2008 we started talking about things over email.  We shared a few personal things.  Susan was a friend of my own friends so we were already part of the same social circles.  We got close (as much as you might be able to over email).  I guess I must've been doing something right because she invited me along on a trip to another country with several of our friends.  Did you get all that?  Susan, myself, and a few other people were all going on a trip to another continent.  This was her idea.

So in 2009 we go.  At first Susan is herself but about two days in a switch flipped inside her head and suddenly she turned distant, bitter, short, angry, annoyed, etc etc.  I didn't understand what was going on and it was putting a serious damper on my ""vacation"".  This went on for two weeks.  She had become a completely different person.  My solution for calming down involves removing myself from a bad situation, but in this case, being trapped on the same bus/car/plane/room/hotel/trolley/whateverthefuck meant I couldn't get away from the problem so I eventually had a panic attack for the first time in years.

We get back, she says she never wants to talk again, we bitch back and forth a few times through email a few times, done.

Well fuck.  Vacation ruined.

Oh, I should clarify, we weren't dating.  Heh, we were ""just friends"".  We never touched each other.

&lt;/story&gt;

The story above occured in 2009 (it is one of several similar stories).  It's been a year to the day, and I'm am still goddamn mad as hell.  I can't even put into words how fucking pissed I am about this.  I cannot fucking believe that someone would treat me so terribly and then later just walk the fuck away like I wasn't worth the trouble.  Furthermore, Susan has manipulated her schedule such that it's either Susan + friends or me + friends for hangouts.  Not that I would show up if she was there anyway.

This incident has unleashed a torrent of pent-up anger and regret and hate and bitterness that has been stewing inside me for years.

When I was a kid, I had a habit of getting the shit beat out of me.  Either at school or at home, someone usually had their first or hand against some part of me in anger.  People told me that they hated me, that I was a burden, that I was stupid, that I should kill myself, that nobody else on this planet would ever love me, or that I was ugly, or weak, or etc etc so on so forth.  I would get things stolen from me, I'd be singled out for ridicule, or wrongly blamed for some crime, or some other shitty thing would happen.  I dealt with it, though, because even when things were absolutely fucking miserable, I would think to myself ""man, when I'm an adult, things won't be so bad, I'll have money and a girl and things will be okay"".

I guess that feeling died in 2003 but I kept finding ""litle reasons"" to hold on.  Now in 2010, I am 25 years old, I go to the gym three times a week, I make almost 80k/year, I have no debt, and I am in good physical health, so shouldn't my life be working out okay?  I am so bitter and angry about how people have treated me that I just want to just get a shotgun and blow my brains all over the inside of my living room.  I cannot stop living in my past.  I still have nightmares about high school, nightmares about Susan, nightmares about women in general and generally feel like shit, all day everyday.  I am 25 years old and while I see people around me having fun and being happy and moving on with their lives I still stand there and think, wait a minute, what about me?  When does all the fun start for me?  Girls?  Hello?

When I go out and ""try"" to do something good for myself, I can tell in the way that people look at me, or the way I'm treated, that people just flat out do not like me.  I know this is because of my defensive nature.  I was taught to act that way by those useless asswipes from my early years.  I cannot break that feeling of ""oh god, this guy/girl is about to totally flip the fuck out and I'm going to be in so much trouble"" when I meet new people.

I'm seeing Susan again at a friend's wedding in about 36 hours.  She emailed me once to say she's ""sorry about what happened last year"" and ""hope you don't have any reservations about seeing [her] at the wedding"".  I am so anxious and pissed and upset I could barf until I turned inside out.  Twice.

We don‚Äôt really joke about this stuff either so idk. I feel really fucking embarrassed. But at the same time how was I supposed to know she was joking :(

Soooooo I guess my question is: is this shit normal or smthn? is it weird that I thought she was being serious?

I feel like maybe I‚Äôm dumb for not being able to differentiate platonic and romantic feelings but I feel like she was being really straightforward about it? And also at the same time who asks that ‚Äúas a joke‚Äù. So was I justified to coming to the conclusion that she liked me? 

Im not too upset that she rejected me in the end- I understand it and like I can‚Äôt really change her feelings so yea I can‚Äôt rlly do much but accept it and move on. I just wanna know if this stuff is like normal or if I‚Äôm had overseen anything

225852,"Feel so brokenI grew up in an abusive household. Mom died young. Dad mentally and physically abused me until I was 17 and killed himself.

After that I lived like a total idiot. Just constantly smoking spliffs (5+ per day) and cigarettes (at least 5) and eat garbage. Spliffs are much worse for you compared to cigarettes. I quit at 27 and started to spiral. I started working out all the time and eat extremely healthy. Gained 20kg (was underweight) etc. I can't believe I was living so unhealthy before that. Like why did I think this was a good idea? I also got obsessive thoughts about what a fool I've been and how I'm going to die of lung cancer as an idiot. I started to get into full panic mode. Felt like it's over for me. It made me act so erratic. Desperately searching for a solution while there's none because I can't restart my life and not smoke at all. 

So.. I had this ex from 2 years ago. She was always very supportive. I broke things off with her because I knew she deserved better than me, but how I did that wasn't nice. I really wanted to talk with her for months now so I had sent her a bunch of messages. I reached out to her again after drinking a few beers with a friend and she finally replied and blocked me. I then made a new account and gave off a suicidal vibe which was really fucked up of me and she got extremely angry. After that I kept wanting to explain myself. She dismissed my concerns. I made a new account to explain myself some more. Without knowing it I was setting myself up to become a stalker. I explained and explained and she had zero empathy, called it whining and so on. She only wanted to hurt me instead of making me get better. In the end she had blocked me like 5 times before she exploded with a message aimed at destroying someone's psyche. It was so many insults in one message. So painful. What hurts me the most is that she said she doesn't have to feel guilt because of our break-up. But why did I do that? It was a perfect relationship for me, but far from it for her. She was much older, hinted at kids, she was much further in life. She didn't deserve my deadbeat loser personality. I fucking took my responsibility and didn't use her for my selfish goals. I end things for her and when I need her at my darkest time she destroys me. 

I felt so bad about what she said. Just having that message repeat again and again and again in my head. I couldn't contain myself. I just HAD to talk with her to stop it. It became this manic obsession. It was raging through my brain. Just sending her messages on insta dm and begging her to reply to talk it out because what she said made me feel so hopeless. I would often delete them and send them again. I would sometimes quit doing it for a week, but her insults started repeating even more heavily in my head. I couldn't see any other solution than talking with her to end the torture in my head. This went on for four months. She never replied. In the end she got so fed up with my shit that she put her Instagram profile on pause. It's during working from home too so I don't have enough distractions and it has ruined my mental health. I constantly think about what she said. For example 'You'll never learn how to live your life'.. It's a sentence that will follow me around forever and I hate that. I hate how I keep thinking about this all the time.

I tried to solve it by continuing to her message her constantly. I'd explain myself and then later that evening think: this is pointless, delete and then I'd do it again because the alternative is worse; I can't have those insults running through my mind. Right now reality is starting to sink in about now how much of a dickhead I am. A horrible, obsessive stalker. I can't live with myself and often think about ending my life because I've fucked up my physical and mental health. I'm struggling to see a way to come back from this. Like.. I'm starting to live much better. I quit smoking, I've seen the light and slowly growing up.. But my fucking past will haunt me forever. I had that I ran into this brick wall with my ex who just wanted to tear me down at my lowest point. I'm fucking changing, why can't you help me!!",suicide

38884,"Suicide keeps finding meI have tried to kill myself once or twice a year since I was thirteen. I am twenty-three now. I am transgender. I recently went on a sex binge following my father's death (March) and totally obliterated my genitals with all the STDs, some of which are incurable. I have uncontrollable epilepsy. I am the absolute worst social engineer and am generally disliked by my peers without a single friend to speak of. The things in life I very deeply want are all more than out of reach. 

I have always been unhappy and find myself writing suicide notes every few months... sometimes I'll pull a plastic bag over my head to feel the sensation of breathlessness and imagine the release of death. A part of me is always fighting, always pushing to preservere (sp?), and often I thwart my own attempts before I can carry them through. But it's a losing battle. I am split down the middle by my productive and destructive self and will do ridiculously dangerous and unrewarding things often, almost as a way to rebel against my very existence, my forced existence. People just happen without volition of their own in a world not of their choosing and I am against it.

My best and most recent suicide attempt was in January. I wish I died then. I romanticize death in a very unhealthy way, this I am aware of, yet I cannot escape it's allure. It haunts me. Thoughts of suicide have haunted me most of my life and I don't think I will ever escape them. I want to die, always. Always. I want to leave. To free myself from this channel of time and disperse into the vast complexity of the universe.

I feel spoiled and selfish, to ""throw away"" what many others wish they had, I know for certain many people would do unspeakable acts to spend a day in my shoes. My suffering is mostly existential and something that comes from self-sabatoge. Even with my own personal emotional/mental/physical/medical problems, I have access to most of the great and wonderous things life has to offer. I am aware, yet, it makes no difference.

I want to die. Badly.

For the first time in my life, two weeks from now, I will receive a stipend large enough to buy my own firearm. To buy a lot of things, really. I'm using it to kill myself. I will hurt my family very badly, what is left of my family, and I am ashamed of it. But... there is never a good time to die, really. Never a good way. I can't live for the sake of others and I struggle to live for myself.

It's only a matter of time before I pull the trigger, literally and figuratively, and then it's lights out for good. This is really more of a long-term type of goodbye... I don't know for sure if I'll choose to die the instant I receive the money. I may wait to stage it in a special place, to take time and make my death everything I want it to be. Because it's honestly the only thing I have control of in this world. My life is the only thing that is truly mine and my death is the only thing I can control.

I saw a therapist. No help.

I saw a doctor who perscribed medication. Some help, still feeling miserable.

I've tried excersize. I've tried drugs. I've tried no drugs. I've tried changing my settings, thinking maybe I was feeling trapped. I've tried cbt. I'm running out of options.

Basic story, I'm miserable working. I've never had a job I've enjoyed. To me, going to work is one of the worst things I can think of. I'm going to work until I retire or die, meaning I'll spend my whole life working, and as I'm unhappy working, I'll be unhappy the rest of my life. I've swapped jobs multiple times, and the things I have interest in doing are unachievable. I can't become a Rockstar, I'm just not good enough,  that's a fact.

So here I am. I begin wondering to myself, at what point is it selfish for the people around me to keep me around, as to avoid a bit of emotional turmoil.

Is it fair making me survive a life I don't want to live so that they may put off missing me until I die of natural causes or they do? How's that fair? If I kill myself you'll suffer 2 or 3 years tops. NROPS if you really like me. This doesn't equal my 50+ years of misery ahead. It just doesn't. 

This is what annoys me too, everyone thinks because I'm depressed I should be thinking ""oh I'm useless to society the world would be better of without me"" but I don't think that. I think if I was a normal motherfucker and not depressed I could live a good life. I have a good life. The only thing stopping me seems to be depression.

So tell me reddit, is there a point where it becomes selfish to keep a depressed individual around even if he worked hard and failed over and over again to deal with or fix his issues?

I'm trying to hard to push myself to be stronger than this... I really am. I've been trying for most of my life. But I don't think I have it in me anymore. I tried many times before. I was okay for a while, but it always ends up just like this, no matter what.

I've tried therapy and medication, neither of which proved to be long term solutions. I've been thinking of trying again before I give up for good. This is really the only thing I have to cling on to; that I just didn't have the right meds. That feels so pathetic. Even as pathetic as that feels, I guess part of me hopes it's true... that there's some pill out there that will make my stupid mind function normally.

Another part of me says why bother? What's the fucking point? What's so wrong with a person not wanting to be here anymore?",suicide

Basically, it all boiled down to him and his relationship with his father. His dad pretty much put my friend's brothers on a pedestal while not really giving a fuck about him. He has been living on his own (with friends) for quite a long time and we all fear that he is still on the verge of possibly another suicide attempt.

After the first attempt, he was taken to a clinic for a week or two, but there still doesn't seem like much change in our friend's self-worth (in his view), so to speak. Now, he has no job and can't afford to live with his friends anymore. It seems like his only option would be to go back and live with his dad, but, of course, that probably wouldn't be such a good idea. His roommates have said that they have done all that they can to help him out, but can't support him anymore.

Is there something that my buddies and I can do to get him on the right track and steer away from those thoughts? I was thinking possibly getting all of the guy's friends and people who care about him in one place and having some kind of intervention, but perhaps that would sort of single him out and make him feel even worse.

Anyways, I‚Äôm done. I tried to kill myself a few years ago. I‚Äôm back at that point and really pushing, but it‚Äôs not holding out much longer.

So yeah,  I will start out by saying that many things have gone wrong in my life, whether by my own fault or from reasons beyond my control. I'm not going to list everything because I don't feel like telling my life story, but here are the two worst and most recent:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Year-long abusive relationship...heard and saw many things that are permanently engrained in my mind and gained negative coping habits and reactions that will stick with me for a long time, also damaged my relationship with my family, will never have their trust again. As a result of the relationship, lost the opportunity to travel for my degree, among other things...essentially gave up everything for this person who gave no fucks, everything was wrong in his eyes.
2.  Finally leave the person, have a few good months before I'm diagnosed with a chronic illness that fucks up my entire body and I almost die.

I'm sick of reliving all these memories, good and bad. The good will never come back and the bad will have lasting damage on my life. Every day is the same shit. I cannot and will never be able to put into words the immense amount of pain I feel, and the awful things I have seen. 

The happiness and success of others kills me. I am certain that the sense of isolation I feel is one that no one else feels. I am even afraid to like something too much, to have something I like even be mentioned for fear that someone will corrupt it for me, and I will have nothing safe left. 

No words can describe what I am feeling, I wasn't able to cry for months until today, when I realized I have no more options. Nothing I'm saying is coherent. Whatever, who cares. There is much more but I'm gonna leave it at this. I'm tired of the fakeness that surrounds me, the fa√ßade I have to put on, and just going to sleep every night, only to wake up and still be alive. I don't want to be here, I don't want to be anything at all, I don't want to exist in any way.

We all got up to about 10 maybe 15 ft from the top and this was a big hill like easily 250 ft, so we get up close to the top and I got stuck. I couldn't grab anything because there were no roots or trees just a rock with a bunch of little like 1/4 inch ledges on it. I used the rock most of the way up but when I got to the end of the rock I started just using my hands and feet to dig into the loose dirt. But I got about two feet from the in the middle of the hill I started to slip there was nothing to grab I just dig my fingers in as hard as I could. I eventually slid down to a little rock that was mostly in the ground. I was able to get my footing on the rock and start back up the hill.

I could never understand why he seldom would never invite me to go once we got closer. then he quit. over the weekend he invited some youth and their parents down to the lake for the day. one family...her family..including her husband...stayed for the weekend. my boyfriend barely looked at me or talked to me. this woman....treated her husband terribly and would rather spend time with my boyfriend than her husband. When I tried to introduce myself...she acted as if I was the ugliest garbage she had ever seen. When my boyfriend was trying to talk to me and flirt with me...to show me some affection...she walked over...opened up her towel to reveal a beautiful...gorgeous body...and said, ""in november..I always put on weight...then in the summer i lose it...then I just start the whole cycle over again.."" and she just walked away... I was so hurt....so upset...and my boyfriend just stood there..looking at her.  I tried to leave the next morning..after a day of being ignored and humilitated...my boyfriend was trembling and asked me to stay. I don't know why.

They are clearly in love with eachother. She lied to her husband. flirted with my boyfriend all weekend...and my bf treated her like a queen.   I just grew more and more angry. I thought leaving would give  my boyfriend what he wanted. I have suspected that he was interested in someone else....he has 3 children...she has ..I think 7? she is gorgeous. fun. flirty.  I am none of that. and Ive been struggling personally with depression and anxiety...forging a new career...I look terrible. I would understand why he would be attracted to her. but I think this has all been going on for a long time....and she is ready to leave her husband now. His children and hers are close....they all really care about eachother...it all fits. Her husband is a puppy...she is going to throw him away.

When I'd make lunch I'd think about how easy it would be just to stab myself with the largest knife in the kitchen. But I was too afraid of failing. If I survived I'd just get sent to a mental hospital to get ""better"".

So after the first month, every night before I go to sleep and as soon as I wake up, I imagine myself getting shot, I still do. I legitimately hope I get murdered so I don't have to do it myself. Because I'm too much of a coward.

As to the why, I have fallen deeply in love twice throughout high school. I fell so hard up until the point where I just confessed my love for them just so I could get the fucking weight off my shoulders. The results were expected, they didn't feel the same, and I knew it going in. I never did anything sbout my feelings because I'm a fucking coward. Now one of them is dating my best friend and the other is going to get married to a narcissistic douche who loves her. The confession to the latter happened in June, (we go to the same college) when I was at the lowest point in my life. Since then I ever so slightly started feeling better. But being home for the holiday brought back all the memories I had with them and it just fucking hurts. Why the fuck did I have to love people who don't love me back?

All that on top of me not knowing what the fuck I'm doing with my life and never being good enough at anything...I just want it to end....

274577,"My life sucksThis might be a little long but idk.. no tldr because this is a lot of my problems and its already summarized. Deal with it.

Let me start out saying that I grew up with my mother until I was 10 years old. I never knew my dad at all because apparently he was ""violent"". My mom married when I was 10, and immediately had a child with my step dad. I really liked him at first but after him treating me really mean as a child I ended up not liking him really quickly. He was mean, one time I remember looking in the mirror in my room as a teenager, minding my own business and he comes in and basically says ""why are you looking in the mirror? is there something in your eye? pretty sure there's nothing behind your eye, you dumb bitch"". I went and told my mom what he said and she ignored me. 

My grandmother said that my mom is married to him to help support her and her new child and she wouldn't stick up for me because she didn't want to loose that support. There was a lot of fighting in our house, most of it consisted of my step dad picking on me for NO reason at all (I would be minding my own business in my room and he would come pick on me and laugh at me) and I would go tell my mom and end up crying to her and having both of them yell at me. He would also come by my door every morning like an hour before I had to get up for school and kick the door in and then slam it, waking me up. He would also wake me up by dripping water on my face and farting on me.


Besides all my step dad and house issues, I had problems with people bullying me all through school, especially high school. I had people spit on me and call me names and other things. I was also raped when I was 16 by my boyfriend at the time. I said no but he kept going. People make fun of me and say its my fault for that because they say ""well you could of stopped him by kicking him or something"" but I didn't want to hurt him because I cared about him. At 17 I was taken out of my house after multiple suicide attempts and being admitted to the hospital, the police put me at a friends house to live with her and her grandma for a few weeks. They then put me back in with my parents because they couldn't find any proof of physical abuse (even though my parents made threats). 

At 18, I had 2 jobs (I had 1 job since I was 15 actually) and my parents started charging me rent. I was trying to go to tech school to get a degree. I ended up getting to stressed out because I had to pay for all my food, rent, books, school, phone, car, insurance ect while I was working 45 hours a week. All while my parents were still being mean to me and verbally abusing me. One time my mom threw a vase at me because I told her I couldnt do chores because I had to work. They would usually make me clean the house and do outside work such as mow our lawn. I also started getting really sick a lot during this time. I couldn't take it and my grades were bad so I dropped out.

I ended up moving out with my boyfriend last summer. I moved in with him and his parents. He was with his parents because he was going to college and didnt want to live in the dorms cause it was cheaper at home. I had a few problems such as his older brother being really mean to me and picking on me and trying to get their parents to hate me. Like for example he messed up the whole house while the parents were away and blamed it on me, even though I was at work. They ended up being really mad at me and almost kicked me out. He would also randomly call me a bitch and just say mean things to me. I never did anything wrong to him so idk why he was acting like that... Anyway during that time last summer I finally had something good happen. I started talking to my real father. I ended up looking up some old police records and called his parents, and ended up finding out his home address and phone number. He lived across the country though, so I only talked to him on skype, we planned to go out and visit him though this spring. It turns out though only a few months of talking to him and actually having a parent, he ends up dying from an accidental overdose on his pain meds. He died over thanksgiving. I am really upset. I just wanted to hug him and meet him and tell him how much I appreciate having a parent in my life. I finally had a parent who wasnt mean to me and he ends up dying. I wish I could talk to him one more time. 

I live with my boyfriend now in an apartment 4 hours away from my hometown. He is in college right now. Things were going ok for a while. Recently my boyfriend lost his job after his car broke down and he couldn't get to work. Now I am supporting both of us. This last month we have been going to food pantries because we are poor.

I have been really depressed lately. I have been really sick and dizzy and nauseous and feel like throwing up. I had the flu for 2 weeks with a high fever. I went to the doctor and they gave me a note but my work won't accept it. I made a post about it here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s97gn/walmart_dday_letter_and_about_to_be_fired/

I didn't have any health insurance until recently, so I was afraid to go to the doctor, especially since we don't really have money the way it is. My health insurance now only covers 1 visit. I went into the doctors right when I started feeling sick and the doctor said they didn't know my medical history so they didn't write me a note. I was really nervous to go in again because I would have to pay everything out of pocket. I went in anyway. Though when I went in I was on pain reliever which also made my fever drop so they said I wasn't sick enough for them to fill out my FMLA paperwork even though I had a hard time even getting out of bed to go to the local hospital. The thing is the night before I went in with a high fever and the walk in was closed so I would have to be admitted to the hospital. The receptionist told me it would cost me a lot of money so I decided to go home. I had already missed a week of work at this point. I forgot to call the 1800 number a few times but I was really confused and could barely sit up in bed. I called in during the day when I was up and I guess the manager then forgot to tell them I called in because I got a write up for no call no show and dday for my absences. 

Idk what to do. I was doing my hour drive home tonight after getting dday/write up and I cried all the way home. The only person I have to talk to is my boyfriend, and he isnt the chatty type, so he didn't know what to say except ""everything will be ok"". But nothing ever goes right for me and my life just sucks. I have been struggling my whole life. I see people and friends who have nice lives, their parents are nice and they get to go to college and have their parents support them and I get really upset. Why cant I have nice parents that would help me go to college? Why cant I have parents that would help me out when I am in need? My mom wont even give me money for food. It makes me mad though because they treat my step sister really nice. She is only 8 but they bought her a laptop and a 3ds recently. She doesn't even like video games and doesn't even NEED a laptop. SHES 8!! I asked for a computer when I was in high school and they wouldn't get me one, I ended up biking all the way to a library daily to do my homework and sometimes didn't get my papers done because the library closed at 9, and most nights after school i worked until 9 because my parents wouldn't pay for my lunches. 

My parents wouldn't  even sign the papers to get a drivers licences. I never got one until I was 18 and my grandma drove me to the dmv. I had a hard time buying my first car too. My neighbor was selling her car, and I was trying to save up for it, right when I got enough and was about to go over there my step dad went over and told her I don't have money and he tried to buy it instead so he could ""sell it to a dealership to get some money for a newer car"" Also my parents put my sister in any clubs or anything she wants. I played violin through out my schooling, and I begged them for a tutor like the other kids had so I could get better at it. I wanted to learn a solo to enter into a college. But they refused. But then they go and buy my little sister a tutor for her violin at age 6. I wanted one in high school so I could get into college.

I sometimes cosplay to make me happy. I know its a weird hobby but whatever. I recently entered a contest though. I didn't win anything, but I found out that the people who won, won unfairly because they were friends with the judges..  I brought this up to the con facebook page and a bunch of people got mad at me saying I was just jealous but I had physical proof (blog pages and pictures) showing the girl who won working on the costume with the judges. They were part of a sewing group together. I just stated that its unfair because staff members cant win contests neither should the same group members. I got a lot of backlash because of it and people even started to threaten me and post my personal information such as my address and phone number on 4chan. I am upset because all these people are mad at me for just bringing up an issue I thought was unfair and now idk if people will judge against me because of it at contests. Im afraid I will never be able to win anything again because of just bringing up an issue... It was my only hobby and thing that made me happy and now its ruined.

I am sick of things never working out. Right now my car has problems I cant fix, and I have doctors bills coming, my work is about to fire me, people are mad at me, I don't have decent parents and I am poor and can't afford my rent this month because of being sick... I am just really depressed.

194151,"I'm mentally exhausted, depressed and I hate myself.As I write this, I feel like I've hit an all-time low. Like I'm being a drama king or something, for dumping all my problems here, in order to seek attention or something, but I don't have anyone to talk to about this stuff.

I'm 34 years old, unemployed and live with my parents; I think that's a good start to why I feel the way I do. Typing that previous line immediately makes me think of George Castana (I'm even starting to go bald), so I guess that, but in real life, except without the constant meeting of friends.

I do have friends, but only a select few, and most of them are siblings, so I guess when you think about it, I only have 2 friends. One lives almost a dozen miles away and neither of us has transportation, which is usually handled by the other friend, who is very busy with an exhausting job that leaves little personal time for them, much less me. I might see them once a month for a few hours, twice if it's a laid back month.

From the age of 13 to about 28 I suffered from a weird urinary tract problem, which as a man, had left me too embarrassed to address. I went to a hospital when it originally surfaced (just as I had started high school, unfortunately), and had minor surgery that I had to take medicine for, but my mother was insistent on me not taking medication, and shortly after my problem was surgically ""corrected"", it returned like maybe a week later. I honestly never really understood the situation, as no one directly discussed it with me, but I continued to suffer in silence for 15 years; over half my life.

It caused me a lot of problems over the years, as obviously people talk about you when it takes you like 15 minutes to use the restroom, which ruined my confidence, not to mention the pain involved. As the years advanced, I eventually got a steady job that I hated and worked at for 4 years, before leaving for a few years (during which almost all my grandparents suddenly passed away in succession), before being asked to come back to that job.

This time around, the pain from my medical problem was becoming increasingly greater, and I was starting to wet the bed. During this ""phase"" of my life, I had always fantasized about suicide, but at this peak, I hit a dark time and told myself that if I didn't get help, I should just end it.

Fortunately, at the sixth month of my second time at this job, I got insurance, which I immediately used to see a doctor in private. This was a big deal, as I had always lived with my parents and never really had any privacy, nor the confidence to do such things privately. The doctor ran some tests and basically told me that my bladder was so full of fluid, that he was surprised that it hadn't backed up into my stomach and killed me long ago. I immediately went into surgery, which caused my family to find out about my situation.

Weirdly enough, they didn't make a big deal about it, which made me feel like I should have been more open about it from that start, and after the surgery, it was like a new chapter of my life opened. I felt great for a long time after that, even when I eventually left that job again. That basically brings us upto now: a few years after leaving that job.

The previous story is important, because I almost forgot about that part of my life (I had effectively blocked the trauma of it until now), but in truth, it molded the mindset that I have now. I feel like I did back then. I feel tired and depressed, alone and pathetic.

I have no job, because I live in the middle of nowhere and have no transportation. At least that's what I tell myself. A man is defined by his monetary contribution, so it's all my family talks about when I see them. In the rare moment that I saw my uncle, he would harass me about being a leech on my parents, despite me not really being a drain on them; I've been living on money that I had cleverly set aside from when I was previously working (although that's about to run out). This is mostly because my father never really has anything good to say about me to his relatives, and even when we worked together at the aforementioned job, he would file untruthful complaints about me to my employer, which ruined my credibility with them. As you can tell, I don't get along with my dad, but am living with him, but that's a mess for another time.

The bottom line is, I feel like crap. For about a year now, I've felt ""drained"". I occasionally get bursts of joy from doing the stuff I love, but at most it fades after a week or so, and it gets less and less each time, sometimes a few days. I'm a huge nerd, loving Anime, writing (mostly tabletop related scenarios, think Dungeons and Dragons content) and video games, but I honestly haven't been able to enjoy much lately. My confidence is so low over the past year, that I can't even bring myself to pick up a pencil or type out anything interesting, without having a panic attack.

I spend a lot of time escaping reality through gaming, but it's pretty short-lived lately, especially due to the social aspect of it. I don't really have fits of anger, but today I lost my nerve while playing a game online and threw my headset, breaking the thing into a ton of pieces. That's really unlike me, and it scared me.

Despite being anti-social, I've gone to great lengths to make new friends to game with or even do other people's activities with, just to make a genuine connection with someone, but always with a couple weeks, people forget and even go to great lengths to avoid me and I don't know why.

Thinking back, I've always felt like a ""Fly on the wall"" when around people. My friends will go on and on about stuff, and when I attempt to include myself, I either get ignored or talked over. I'm not sure it's their fault, their good friends, but I have a soft spoken voice and kind of get trampled over easily. This is why I enjoy nerdy activities like Dungeons and Dragons, as I get to be in charge, to tell a story and other people have to listen to me, although as stated before, I rarely have anyone to indulge in that stuff with anymore, hence confidence issues.

Over the years, I had attempted to tell people about my pains, but everyone either dismissed my issues (because I'm a man) or tried to compete with my problems by telling things about themselves that they thought were worse than my situation (which only makes me feel worse). I feel like I'm stuck in this endless cycle of depression, which for a long time left me unable to maintain a normal sleep schedule, which people only judged me more for. I am currently sleeping ""normally"", although I've noticed that all my worries are starting to slip me back into my old self (I've been going to bed at 2am, instead of midnight, so it's begun).

I'm lonely. Not just because I'm single, but because I have no one to relate to. Every time I try to talk to someone, even online, they always excuse me that their too busy. It's like no one wants anything to do with me. Which makes me wonder... why am I struggling so hard to hold onto everything?

I don't think I would ever actually do anything serious, like suicide, but I'm just so mentally exhausted. I feel like a lot of it is that I need to get out more, go walking and exercise, and what not, but I have trouble doing stuff like that without motivation, and no one ever wants to motivate me to do anything. I'm alone.

I've you've read this far, thanks. Sorry if it kind of devolved into a rant near the end. I'm kind of just writing in the moment and lost my train of thought. I had a message planned at the beginning, but then my fingers just did it's own thing.

To be honest, I'm not really sure what I'm doing here. I don't think writing this will make me feel better, but I've already committed like an hour to this, so I might as well finish. There's a ton of stuff I didn't write here, but I've already wasted enough of everyone's time.",suicide
215674,"I just don't see the point in continuing... Why should I?26/DMAB, identifies and lives as F... even though I'm just a sick tranny....

The more I look at things, the less I see of a reason to live. I started my ""hormone correction"" far too late in my life, getting therapy and ""help"" at 25 years old... a year later I thought I'd feel better, but I don't. I don't feel worse, but I don't feel better... It feels normal to be identified as a woman and treated as such and I don't face issues with misgendering. However, it just feels... empty, like everything is a freaking lie...

I have a serious anxiety attack anytime I take a shower, I have to close my eyes showering.. going to the bathroom and do things quickly before I have a severe panic attack. My genitals are the reason I suffer, they're wrong and mismatched and for as long as I can remember have caused me discomfort that has escalated with the years. I was told by a friend year ago when I was about to take my life that I could get help and work towards transition with the help of obamacare... and admittedly that's why I'm around today, because I did get help and I did get the treatment to start fixing my chemistry.

But there's so much damage already done, everyone I know insists I'm a ""cute girl who just doesn't like makeup"" but I always see a man, the man I was forced to see my entire life. The man my verbally abusive oldest sister constantly reminded me I was going to become. My family has tried to be supportive since I nearly killed myself over this... but is more neutral than anything, respecting pronouns and name but not helping me with literally anything else.. leaving me to do everything by myself, which I've tried... I've tried so much... I'm expected to know so much things that I never got to learn about.

I'm breaking down, I'm falling apart and I can't take it anymore... I was robbed of a life I could of had, because I was raised in a gender non conforming household. My natural behaviors and even stating I hated my genitals at a young age just seemed like me rejecting masculine social roles but it was so much more. I still get told I showed ""No real signs"" despite how much I hated my body and envied the hour glass shape... the soft features of most female celebrities and just the fact I hated my body with a passion. Still do, even though I have the stature a lot of AMAB trans would love to have...

So now I'm spoiled.. and entitled, I don't deserve what I got and I deserve to die because I'll never know what it's like to not pass. With how many times I've been driven off to the ER, I can't lie when I say I wish I did die those days. I'm nothing but a mistake... nothing but a freak and I just can't do it anymore.

My heart is at risk of heart failure due to my high levels of anxiety and stress caused by my recognition of my incorrect genitalia... I have to tuck 24/7 which is causing a loss of blood circulation with how tight I have to do it... The moment said tuck starts to slip I start feeling my chest hurt... I was denied trans healthcare by my insurance a few weeks ago and had to switch providers but who's to say the same won't happen again.. especially with LGBT protections being rolled back?

My psychiatrist is working with the surgeon who will perform GRS to stress how medically necessary the surgery is for my case... but my mind is wavering and falling apart, I probably can't mentally handle the surgery anymore.. not that it'd be covered, not that my tranny surgery deserves to be covered.. doesn't matter if I'm dying from worsening anxiety and stress leading to heart failure, it's one life right? I mean who cares about one more Male to Trans dying.... I'm not an actual woman and I revoked my right of being a ""man"" not that I ever felt like one to begin with....

Then the surgery itself.. the more I think about it, will it even help? What I want is impossible, I can't medically become a cis woman... I'll always be trans, and a trans woman... and I'll always be subjected to the stigma that I'm nothing but a man with the idea of fetishizing feminine stereotypes... Since being outed as trans to my groups makes me feel more dysphoric, coming to realization I am a fake.. I feel like I'm hiding my black book.

A black book full of why I want to die and why I don't think this life is worth continuing anymore... how it feels like no one can relate to me dying to genital dysphoria and how a surgery that could alleviate said surgery is being seen as cosmetic and unnecessary... I can't work a job because of how alarming my dysphoria is and how frequent my anxiety spikes due to it.... my head is seldom straight anymore and the crappy contract desk WAH job I have got me enough money for post care costs if the insurance does decide to cover it.. which they won't.

Even if it all works out... I'll never find love because I'm too scared to make a move... too scared to risk telling someone I'm trans that I feel we connect and too scared to try and hide it and pretend like it isn't the case.. I'd probably be killed but.. it's okay, I'd deserve it.

So now I'm sitting here wondering how long it'd take me to die if I sliced off my genitals.. I don't care about pain, I deserve to suffer.. clearly.... I want to live, but I also don't see the point in trying...",suicide

Graduated, got a job as a software assembler. Can't focus for shit, think ADD is taking me over because all I want to do is browse. I'm not sure what's gonna happen yet but if I end up fired, that's it. We had a meeting yesterday outlining the lack of workflow, basically. I'm so worried. Two managers are gonna have a meeting today about it (one was out yesterday).

My gf. Basically a member of the family. Lost her last night. She said it's not me but the relationship itself is making her feel restricted. That she loves me, still wants to be part of the family, she just wants her life together and wants a chance to travel in the future. She says she can't take me with her though. So, she wants to be able to travel in the future and stuff and I can't come with her. She wants to be best friends though. Still wants to have dinner with the family and stuff. I can't handle it. I couldn't stop crying last night. I don't get it. The last girl I expected this from. My whole life and everything. Friendzoned. I'm only able to cope by holding onto the hope that we'll be together again. But I doubt it. I'm just disappointing myself but that's what's getting me by. 

She's the only girl out there who ever understood me. So I thought. I've never remained friends with an ex before. Until now. 

I've never wanted to end my life more without her, she was the only girl who actually understood me. And now I've got nothing. I wasn't meant to be happy, my life's not worth sharing, I'm a miserable piece of shit. I wanna end it. If I lose this job, I might. No one would miss me.

112927,"Step-dad with PTSD threatening suicideHey guys, first of all I'd like to thank you all for what you all do all the time, helping people here and such.  You are all amazing people for dedicating your time and efforts for such a noble cause.


I come to you today as a quite happy person, but I'm worried about my step-dad.  He's like a second dad to me.  


He's a war veteran from Desert Shield and suffers from some PTSD.  His (to my mom and my knowledge) PTSD is very episodic and rare; maybe twice a year.  It seems that when work and life gets very stressful for him, the combination of that stress and possibly some alcohol triggers some bad PTSD attacks.


Usually they're the typical ""I need my gun"" types, but a few nights ago he was talking purely about suicide.  He came home fairly drunk from a friend's house, and kept drinking here at home.  Then my mom and him got into a confrontation and she hit him, which triggered a huge psychological freak out as he was abused as a child and in the marines.   He started saying that he is never happy and hasn't been since he was 19 (before the marines).  He was repeatedly saying that he was just going to go to the local gun store and just get a shotgun and end it.  Needless to say, my mom and I are **very** worried.  


This was two days ago, and after a day of rest (yesterday) he seems almost completely back to normal.  This *has* happened before (threatening suicide) about a year ago in a similar situation, but I'm just really worried that it's something that he thinks about more often than he's expressed.  He's always reluctant to get any type of psychological treatment, but does do monthly trips to the Veteran's hospital for treatment.


We're trying to keep a close eye on him, but do you guys have any suggestions on gauging how ""recovered"" he really is from this episode?  Or any ways to try and help him?  We are going to do all we can to get him to start more treatments at the VA but I'm afraid that this new attempt to control his behavior and force him to see therapists could make things worse.",suicide

okay, what I want to know, is why you are doing this.
oh
Twisted Galaxy
You can copy image and paste it..
And I'm doing this because... no one cares about me, no one likes me, no one loves me... 

Twisted Galaxy
No one will realize I'm gone 
Thats why I'm doing this..
what about your family?
Twisted Galaxy
I don't have family... 
I'm adopted..

Why are you trying to help me if you need to sleep. 
because I don't want you to end your life
Twisted Galaxy
Why 
because that's really sad
Twisted Galaxy
You don't like me. 
You don't care. 
what makes you think that? I hardly know you?
I care though.
just because I don't know you doesn't mean I don't feel empathy for you when you say you want to commit suicide
Twisted Galaxy
I've been trying for three years.. 
I'm on pills... 
I've been sent to hospitals. 
is there anyone with you right now?
Twisted Galaxy
No. 
I'm in a cold dark room. 
why are you alone?
also that image says otherwise
Twisted Galaxy
What image. 

that one
Twisted Galaxy
Thats my hand. 
it also shows you are in a lit room
Twisted Galaxy
so..I turned off the lights. 
is anyone in your house right now? and if so, why aren't you talking to them?
Twisted Galaxy
Because they won't help me. 
have you tried to ask them?
Twisted Galaxy
They will bring me across the country. 
If I talked to them about it again. 
and it won't help?
Twisted Galaxy
nope 
you need to tell them then so they can find how else to help you
Twisted Galaxy
Won't help.. 
No one can help whats happened to me...
how do you know that?
Twisted Galaxy
I've been sexually assulted. 
And raped. 
I'm sorry to hear that but I can't really help you much more because I have no experience with anything like that. I know that it has happened to my mother but she is still alive so it's not impossible to deal with
Twisted Galaxy
My mom went through the same... 
She's alive but suffering anxiety and depression lung cancer and other stuff. 
I'm suffering my own medical problems.
wouldn
oops
wouldn't your mom be upset if you killed yourself
Twisted Galaxy
No. 
she hasen't seen me in years. 
you really need to call the suicide hotline
Twisted Galaxy
Plus her and i suffer anxiety depression lung cancer but I also suffer bipolar, liver dysfunction and kidney disease, 
that's really the only advice I can give you. the people on the suicide hotline have spent years dealing with situations just like yours.
Twisted Galaxy
....
I tried calling different hotlines. None work for me. 
I can't give you any more advice, I am 13 and I am not good as a suicide hotline.
just promise me you won't do it
if no one, it upsets me greatly
Twisted Galaxy
why..
because I've been through it. I never planned or attempted suicide but I still know how depression feels
empathy is part of our genetics
Twisted Galaxy
...
-Hugs you tightly- 
I'm not trying to make your situation seem like it's minor because it really isn't.
Twisted Galaxy
I wish someone can hold me... -Cries into your chest- 
also I don't believe that it doesn't affect you when someone tells you to kill yourself
you said it doesn't
but if you really need someone
and someone you don't really know can affect your feelings positively
it could also go horribly wrong
Twisted Galaxy
....
C-Can you hold me.... 
virtually
Twisted Galaxy
yeah..
...

Twisted Galaxy
You could've typed 
-Holds you- 
actually spacing is wonky in this chat (believe me, I tried)
Twisted Galaxy
I have a question...
yeah?
Twisted Galaxy
d-do you l-like like me....
why would you ask that?
if I didn't like you I would have gone to bed
yet here I am
despite the fact that my mom keeps telling me to go to bed
Twisted Galaxy
like like though...like more then friends...
is what i mean...
I'm only 13, that's silly
Twisted Galaxy
....
üíî 
now i'm crying again....
Why do you care so much what other people think?
Twisted Galaxy
..
i-i'm going to suicide now....
Are you manipulating me?
Twisted Galaxy
no.
I'm really getting that vibe
If you're not, then I feel terrible. But only you know the truth so just know this. If you are baiting me, maybe because you want me to be sad, it's not working.
I am sad, but it's not making me want to kill myself
Twisted Galaxy
why the fuck would I want people to suicide...
because I can't know for sure if you're baiting
I want to believe you are because this situation is quite sad
that's how much I care if you are being serious
I'd literally rather you be lying to me
Twisted Galaxy
....
Can you cuddle me....
Vertual  
I think I've already shown you I care
It's way more important than sending you some ascii art
if you are not baiting, don't be upset that I believe it's a possibility
My mom just said she is coming in and shutting off my computer in a minute. 
You need to stay safe and get some help. Like I said I have empathy but I don't have any experience to help you deal with this. Best
Twisted Galaxy

I'm an 18 year old female, only child. My parents split up when I was around 3-4 so I've never really lived with my father or spent a good deal of time with him. My mother got remarried when I was 5-6 to a really nice man. When I was a little older I found out she was cheating on him with a man over the internet. She would make me take pictures of her in lingerie (nothing really sexual, just poses) and she would tell me she just wanted them for her self when I had asked. She even flew out to see him and made me stay with her sister so I wouldn't be left alone with my Step-dad. It went on for along time. During this time I had stopped talking to my dad because he was heavily into drugs and he preferred to see his girlfriend and her kids over me. Near the beginning on 2009 is when we lost our house to the bank just as my high school started. This was also the time that I had found my mothers pot stash. 

We moved, and moved until we came to this little half house on a nice street. It was ok for a little while and I was pretty happy. Until she met another man who used her for money and a place to stay. She was pretty pissed off at me all of the time. She started hitting me and throwing things at me like butter knives and shoes. I didn't happen often enough for me to say anything to anyone and I never got hurt from it but I never knew what I did to deserve it. I finally stood up for my self and would grab her wrist before she could hit me. She would call me names and tell me to never raise a hand to her again even when it was self deference. I told her she should have just gotten an abortion and she said to me ""If I would have if I had known you would have turned out like this"". After 5 years of not seeing my dad he came back into my life and had cleaned himself up. I told him what she had said to me and how she was treating me. He told me that previous to me she had an abortion and that the only reason she didn't have one for me was because the doctor said if she did she wouldn't be able to conceive again. He didn't mean it hurtfully he was crying because he couldn't believe she said that to me.

We eventually moved again to a rented house so that her new man could move in with us with all of his stuff. I lived in the basement during this time and he made me keep the cats locked up down there because he didn't like cats. He was the type of man that would expect to be catered to. Mom always made sure that his dinner would be brought to him and it would always be what he wanted to watch or what he wanted to do. She was constantly buying him things like little helicopter toys that he would use to terrorize my cats with. The end of this happened when she found out he had been cheating on her all along with his best friends wife. We let this woman into our home...

We moved again to where we are now in our little apartment and we've been here for a year and a few months. I graduated from high school this last year. I had planned on going back to high school for a ""victory lap"" (which is just grade 13) because I wasn't sure what I wanted to go to school for. I stuck it out for a few months but it was hard to go back without any friends. I eventually convinced my self that I had to do something In January so I left school and signed up for a program I knew I probably wouldn't like just so I could get out. 

By the time January had rolled around I was nervous beyond belief, I had breakdowns and panic attacks just the thought of being in a strange city, rooming with strangers. It wasn't like they were in different to me- they tired to include me in activities. I just couldn't handle it and cried my self to sleep every night for 2 weeks straight. I bagged my mom to let me come home. 

Believe me, I feel really pathetic about it- I felt trapped and overwhelmed. I've stopped talking to my dad again because he feels the need to get high every time I see him. I've also not done anything since I left my failed college attempt. I don't feel the energy to do anything. I'm not motivated by any means. My mother never fails to tell me how pathetic she thinks I am and how much of a failure I have become. It feels as though she is bi-polar. One minute she is normal the next she calls me out. When I try to defend my self she only amps up the insults. I get called a bitch-cocksucker quite often I'll have you know. And she does not hesitate to tell her friends how much of a terrible kid she thinks I am. I finally called her out yesterday on everything shes done. I mentioned how I knew I was a mistake and that she was a terrible parent and a compulsive liar. She completely lost her shit. She told me she couldn't believe that I would ever say that to her, how I was as ungrateful bitch. I don't really know who she is kidding. She is trying to keep her act to an audience that already knows all her tricks. I told her that I should probably commit suicide, she told me to go ahead and ""be crazy like your father"".

The suicide thoughts are overwhelming. I think about it all of the time. Wondering if the rod in my closet would be able to support my weight, if the pills in my place would do the job,  and if my friends would even care if I diapered. I have too much pride to do any of that. I and I have always thought suicide to be weak. But I think if someone were to just slit my throat or if I died in my sleep I wouldn't mind. I just feel so trapped. I want to leave so badly but I am so scared of the real world and if i don't stay here I'm scared I wont go to college for real. All I can do to keep my self from not going insane is to play video games and talk to strangers about my feelings.

Thanks for listening. I'm sorry it was so long. ",suicide

I'm male, I'm turning 22 next month, and I can't recall the last time I've truly felt okay ... The frustration I feel is absolutely gut wrenching,  and I feel like the only way out is through death.

The depression never ends and the only remaining comfort I have left is in the fact that I have a viable means to escape everything.

He lost his best friends( who now seemingly doesn't care about him anymore ) after he helped them hook up. and its been giving him depression. The feeling of being left out, not being cared for anymore, stuff like that. His parents knew about it, they had a fight and accused him of being gay. recently I've been trying my best to cheer him up. always trying to talk to him. give him games so he can stop thinking about them, but it isnt helping. Today He was supposed to meet up with his former best friend to clear things up, but the girl didnt show up for reasons i dont know about. That pushed him to the edge. We talked a while ago after that incident and he told me he's gonna end his life and he seems really serious about it. He lives far from me so I don't know what to do. He also already talked to me about suicide before, but Ive always been able to talk him out of it, but now seems to be different. I don't know what to do.",suicide

I had planned to take the full bottle of xanax I had lying around with some old norcos and drink a handle of whiskey and slowly see if I could keep my eyes open. I wrote a letter telling certain people I loved that it wasn't their fault and I'm sorry.

I've just become so unhappy with the person I've become. I am so selfish and lack any sense of self-control and it's been a huge burden on the ones I've loved. I don't want to keep doing that to them. I don't want them to have to worry about me or put aside time to comfort me or give me someone to talk to. I know I've disappointed and hurt them at times and I can't bare to be that person anymore. 

Its hard knowing that my family and close friends might blame themselves and I just want them to be okay with this. I want so badly to let them know that this isn't their fault and they did their best. I want them to remember me as their friend, their brother, their son that was always happy-go-lucky and used humor as a coping mechanism. That I tried my best to be a good person and do the right thing. That I just wanted to make people happy and help those around me. I don't want them to remember this part of me.

I don't know where to start because I don't know where it all went wrong, so I guess I'll start from the beggining.
I am someone who grew up in Spain to english parents. My childhood was not a happy one and it hasn't got any better since then. I come from a dysfunctional background my parents never seemed to get along were and always are fighting over the stupidest things it almost feels like they enjoy it but I certainly don't it has had an enormous impact on me. I was never very close to either of my parents but the relationship with my dad was specially distant to the point where the only interaction I ever had with him was when he would abuse me I can distinctly remember him telling me was going to kill me at one point and I wish he had. This is something that I have been thinking about a lot lately since I wonder if this was a major contributing factor to me being gay and it probably was since it is now known that people aren't simply born gay and that environmental as well as biological factors play a role in this development.
I have also never had a lot of friends or hobbies and for a long time I didn't care at all except some periods of my life where it did make me very anxious to think i lacked a social life and that people very obviously didn't like me and would make it very clear to me.
In my third year of secondary school i was failing big time in school so my parents sent me to a really bad boarding school and I have in hindsight understood that this school was very very academically bad like really shit specially to British academic standards, but in this school I had a good group of friends and I didn't know it would lead my life to the deep end of the toilet so I was relatively happy.
When i finished secondary school I went to a new school once again where I didn't have any friends which made me incredibly lonely and made me feel so so so inferior. This inferior complex is something I'd been dragging along all my life specially since I have always been a bit effeminate and my brother was always the athletic cool attractive charismatic type of guy and always put me down for being kind of gay and sometimes did so in front of my mother and she would say nothing to stop him which made the whole subject all the more taboo to me. I now have no problem admitting that I'm gay and being overtly effeminate, I'm over it. But I would still rather be dead than gay. Another fact I hate about myself is the fact that I am a third culture kid and specially that I am grew up in the cancerous country of spain, it's just so shit it just is. I just wish I had grown up in england so fucking bad because I have to watch as my cousins go to good schools and good universities and I grew up in a shit country and had a really bad education as well as having to feel like an immigrant both in England and Spain. It baffles me so much how some English people can dislike the country and think its intolerant when its one of the most if not the most tolerant country in the world.
When i finished baccalaureate I moved to england and started uni in a city which I at first thought was great but then realized was a really poor choice aswell as started a degree which I dropped out of because I knew fuck all about the subject going in and realized was not what i expected at all. My social life at this stage was absolutely terrible in my first year I basically lived alone because I hardly saw my two housemates and I only had one friend who I went out with every few weekends. Up until the end of the year I didn't really care about the fact that I didn't have friends it wasn't even something I though about because I had filled my head for the past few years with sjw ideology which had me believing i was superior to other. Although during the Easter break when I went home to Spain I met a guy who I liked a lot and he seemed to like me and i fell for him in a massive way because I was in such need for companionship even though I didn't realize it. Then i came back to England to continue with the course and we Skyped almost every day for two months after which i went back to spain and he then broke up with me. This was when my depression really started to unfold I had had periods of suicidal though throughout my life starting when I was about 8, but this was the event that lead me to being how I am today. After this I went back to england for about two weeks in which I was completely alone and all I did was think about him and completely beat myself up about it. Then i went back to Spain for the summer and was the loneliest time of my life I had to watch as my ex and everyone I knew went to music festivals and enjoyed their summer as I sat on my sofa all say because the few friends I have are incredibly boring and what to do absolutely nothing. This is a trend with the people I befriend they super boring people who don't like doing anything. Then I had some hope that my life would improve going into my second year of uni which was even worse by december I had already decided I was going to kill myself. I moved in with two friends who I absolutely love but are also incredibly boring one of them is also very depressed no social life and only plays videogames all day. I got hooked on weed became too depressed to do anything and eventually dropped out for three months after that I stayed at home doing nothing, I had told my parents I would find a job but what I hadn't told them was that I was planning on saving to get euthanized in switzerland which I now know isn't as simple as just paying the money. In july I moved to a different city with a friend from school and with my overall skills the only job I can aspire to is working in a warehouse (dream job I know). So now I am five months out of uni and my only plan is to commit suicide and I plan on doing it. I cannot deal with the fact that I grew up in Spain and that I'm gay I blame my parents for these two thing (because they have made me a weirdo with no chance of a normal life) and have a massive amount of resentment towards them. So I don‚Äôt care if I hurt them the only people in my family I care about hurting are my sister and my grandparents but I have reached a point where I just can‚Äôt deal with life anymore I‚Äôve had more than I can take. The decision is more than made I'm doing it.",suicide

12448,"Abusive Relationship Destroyed EverythingMy boyfriend of six months just told me I needed to choose between him and my family. I knew it was an insane thing to ask, and I walked out the door. That was a few days ago, been NC since. But I'm realizing this relationship destroyed so much more than I'd realized. We are both from the same small culture and the same small community for that culture in our region. Everybody knows I was with him, and he is telling people that my ""crazy family"" is to blame for him ""leaving"" me. (Incidentally, my family might not have seemed ""crazy"" to him if he hadn't been openly and consistently rude to them.) His ties in our community are stronger and more authoritative than mine. I can no longer show my face around the community or in our house of worship (or in any of the ones affiliated with ours in the region, because he is connected to all of them). In addition, my career is very tightly linked to this community and is dependent on having good relations with many of our community's institutions. He has destroyed that for me, even going so far as to estrange me from some very important professional contacts, whom he happens to be close to, by making up lies about me. These contacts were really instrumental in helping me build my career. Before I met him, I was developing good relationships with these people and I felt happy that I was getting an opportunity to earn their respect. And now they are against me because of him. On top of all that, the pressure that this man put on my family has caused them to pull away from me, and now they say they are ""done with me"" because I have ""become a different person"" even though I am no longer with him. He ""changed me,"" they say, and they want no part of the new person that I have become. 

After six months of him trying to separate me from my family (I stupidly thought I could get him to a point where he would be ok with them), snapping at me, saying mean things to me under the guise of ""caring about me,"" and screaming at me randomly for no reason, I am finally out of this bad relationship, but everything in my life has been shattered by it. My bright future is not what it used to be. He has destroyed my relationship with my family, my career, and my standing in our community. Nothing will ever be good again. 

I have never thought about suicide before, but now I just cannot stop thinking about swallowing a bottle of Tylenol PM with a bottle of vodka and just ending it. Last night I even took my first baby step into ""practicing."" I've taken Unisom before to help me sleep, even though I know that sometimes it makes my heart feel funny and stop breathing in the night. Normally I'll take 25mg. Last night I took 100. I knew it wasn't nearly enough to kill me, but I just wanted to see what would happen. I know that sounds sick. An hour went by before I had to jump out of bed and vomited it all up (not on purpose). It was very unpleasant. The only thing really stopping me from trying again is the thought that I might actually survive it and be fucked up for life. I work in a field where even a little bit of brain damage would end my career, so I can't afford to fail. Sometimes I think, ""What if life gets better?"" but I don't see how it could possibly get better after this relationship--with a man I really thought was The One--has not only failed but has also left my life in shambles.

I met a lot of people there that now I won't ever see again.There was a girl in there that stick with me for some reason, she was lonely at the time and played by herself, and so was i. She was 1 year older than me i remember being friends with her but its to vague so I can't remember much more really.
Lets call this one Girl A

---- 7th,8th,9th grade ----

On those 3 years i liked a normie girl and she basically was just my opposite but somehow i had butterflies with her. After corona arrived in march, i told her i liked her and i knew she wouldn't really care because we were not that close and i was shy as fuck around girls
Lets call this one Girl B

---- present ----

 Now that i am in visual arts, i got like 24 girls in my class that helped me get over my girl shyness a bit in the past month. I met an awesome girl from another class, she draws beautifully well, we talk a lot in chat but not often in group because we are both a bit introverted, and i really like her as a person but for now I didn't get butterflies with her and i am worried that i won't ever get.
This is Girl C

---current situation---

So before i even started 10th grade i stalked Girl A in instagram and saw that she was in the same school that i was going to. I was completely crazy because i didnt see her face in years and the nostalgia beat like fuck. I broke my introvert barriers and sent her a message asking if she still remembered me. She didnt answer and it hurt a lot.

One month later i enter school (yeyyy¬ø) I got friendly with my class but not much because I am too picky with my friends but one day we all went lunch in the shopping and I found girl B (she continued in the school i was before) who i didnt see for 6 months because of the lockdown and i got a bit of butterflies, i just want to forget her because there is just no way that anything between us could be possible and go well.

Some time after that i got friendly with a girl from the other class of arts, which is girl C that i already referred to. Tldr she is just perfect in personality (not much in looks but i dont really care) we talk almost everyday and send memes to eachother and she seems to like me too.

So...today.
I had a dream that affected me for the rest of the day. Girl B and me were at the cinema and she had her head in my shoulder and i had my arm around her. Because of that i had butterflies for the rest of the day somehow.
I spent my lunchbreaks with girl C and a group of friends like i normally do and I wasn't having butterflies around her which really is depressing because she seems like the perfect one. During classes i could only remember the dream i had that night and got butterflies every time. 
So i wanted to test something, i went to my previous school that was where Girl B was having classes and i wanted to talk to her to see if i was still in love with her or not. My previous school and my current are really close to eachother btw.
In the time i was waiting for her to get out of her school, i was with some people of my class that were waiting for a bus. One of them had a friend who was with Girl A! I knew who she was but I didn't knew if she remembered me, i was too paralized to even talk to her. She sometimes seemed like she was looking for me but she could as well be looking to the number of the bus she was taking. After some time of me pretending to be well, after they all took the bus i just went home because i couldn't handle seeing Girl B when i was extremely stressed and paralyzed.

So my dilemma is... What the fuck do i do?
I cant manage to talk to Girl A after she ignored my message and i dont know if she remembers me or if she even cares about that.
I am still in love with Girl B who i want to forget but i cant.
I want to fall in love with Girl C but its only been a month.
Btw my school might close for the next weeks or so, the corona has been growing again and it's expected for it to close.
What can do i do with this 3 Girls before its too late? I really want this to be solved before school closes.",non-suicide

253883,"Epiphany on the selflessness of SuicideI wanted to write this down somewhere because I still struggle with thoughts of suicide. A moment ago, I had an epiphany, why I hadn't really taken the final steps.

It's not because I know people love me. I've used that as my sole reason why--it would devastate everyone I know. Then thinking about my toddler girl, how she would never be the same if I did such a thing. 

Then the thought occurred to me: I love her so damn much. I love my husband, and I love my unborn daughter. I love my parents, my siblings.

So, it's not the fact that I know they love me that stops me. But that if I died, I would be taking away their experience of MY love for them. By taking myself out of the world not only shows that I didn't care they love me, but that I would be taking MY love away from THEM. They'd never experience my love again.

My love for them should always outweigh my own self-love. By loving them, I can love myself in healtheir ways.

So, death by suicide would be the most selfish thing I'd do. And appearing selfish is one of the hardest thing and what I hate about myself the most. I'm selfish. But I will never do the ultimate act of selfishness.

So, I hope from here on, my thoughts will get easier.",suicide

50423,"Will I regret posting this? This is a letter I wrote about a girl yesterday. Lets call her Sarah.
I want to start by saying that this year has not been easy. I have been more depressed than ever this year and thinking about this does not exactly help that. But I think in order to recover, I at least need to address it. I like you and have since sophmore year. Big suprise, right? I have a weekness when it comes to these situations because I have pretty bad social anxiety. I hope that explains why I was awkward around you almost constantly. I really wanted to be close to you and I guess I ruined that by being too passive. I also didn't want to ruin our frindship by asking you a question that would make it awkward, so I didn't. You have ruined all other girls for me. Yesterday(Feb 13) I tried to flirt with a girl but all I could think of was how much I missed you. Losing contact with you over quarantine has hurt more than anything. Even if I never see you again, I want you to know that I have changed for the better since knowing you. I used to be a dick and not care how much I affected other people.¬† After knowing you, I now know the impacts of my actions on others. Through your kindness and compassion I finally understand others a little more. You were kind to me even when noone else would. 

I will now point out some of my favorite moments that we shared: 
When we shared earbuds at our school's trip fundraiser, When you would steel my phone to play that stupid game, When you would write little inside jokes on my play script. 
You made my high school experience bareable.
Thank you, Sarah

343641,"Abandoned at every turn. Loneliness is getting the better of me.When I was born I was left for adoption by my parents. My adoptive family however left me for foster care after a few years. Growing up in foster care wasn't all that nice. I was given to various homes and at time there were abuse and at times things were nice but nobody ever took any interest in me.

After 18 I found my adoptive family who told me that the reason they left me was that they changed their minds about being parents. Well. They're still parents as they have their own kid so I smelled BS but it is what it is. They gave me details of my birth family and I found that they have two other kids who they raised. One older and one younger than me. So they never wanted a second kid and I came by accident, so they left me for adoption. A third kid came by accident and they raised her. Ain't I the luckiest kid on the block.

So at 18 I was lost and confused and got hooked up with some bad company and an older guy who played on my issues and got me into his gang of young boys. He got us moving drugs around the city. Well I was busted and I didn't rat him out and I even confessed to something he did so I did 8 years. Nobody came to visit me not my family not that guy. The horrors that happened to me on the inside is another subject altogether. I got out and I was basically on my own. Couldn't find a job anywhere until I left the city did some hitchhiking and ended up at a small village where I got a job on a farm. It was nice. Good people who never asked about my history. I stayed there for two years until I made the mistake of telling someone about my past and he told everyone and they wanted me to go.

I was moved and moved until found a place to stay with a very old couple in the middle of nowhere and I've been there ever since. It's not bad but I mean it's super lonely and no future so I don't know.

I have no reason to keep going. I've been thinking about ending it more and more and while I'm not feeling at my lowest right now I think it's just a matter of time for me. I always dream of dying in peace in a place where nobody would even care. It makes me feel peaceful. ",suicide
271785,"Being forced here by a thread.I write this as I should be walking out my door, starting yet another day of this broken existence of mine.  Failure has corrupted me.  Sadness has taken me.  I have finally been raped by the words of others, after years of remaining somewhat resolute.  I have lost those that I hold closest. In short, without going too far into my story - for the sake of time - I am sad, lonely, and I have no interest in living anymore.

-I hit the snooze button again at this point-

I have, for quite some time, been ambivalent towards the idea of death.  It's a scary prospect, not living anymore.  Through our existence, we have only known one thing, and that's life. It's what's familiar to us, and we are understandably scared of just not ""being"" anymore. 

I had, up until recently, not cared whether I lived or died.  I would be curious as to whether the large truck next to me on the road would suddenly swerve into my lane, throwing me off into the thick wooded area to my other side.  I had a nightmare about this once, I remember ,during better times, and it frightened me.  I didn't want to die.  I didn't want to have those last few seconds of struggle and confusion, leading to that nothingness.  I had things, people to live for.  

Now, I only have obligations.  My mind is diseased, unable to take happiness, knowing that it will eventually be taken from me, leaving a larger hole than the space that happiness once occupied. My heart is riddled with such holes, and I have no interest in forming any more.  I don't want to take the effort living up to the expectations of me. I simply can't, no matter how hard I try.  I have to put on a face - a mask - to hide the fact that I'm despairing so that others don't feel uncomfortable around me (this mask has since fallen off - apathy wins out again). 

Without being religious, I am a very morally-obsessed person.  I've studied more philosophy and psychology than anyone else I know.  I think it is this reason, as well as my own cowardice, that I am still here.  I can't bear the thought of leaving such a hole - as I have mentioned earlier - in the lives and hearts of others.  I can't seek treatment (though I have my personal objections against this, though probably illogical) because my parents would think that they are failures - that I am (as I am) a sick, depressed child that they created and led down this path (as I am not - this is my own doing). For the very same reasons and more, I cannot kill myself normally.  My friends - as few as they are - would hate themselves for ignoring the signs (or so I hope they would.  I don't know for certain), my parents for their ""failure"", the people I interact with every day for the fact that they could have tried (most likely without success, but I don't know) to make things better. 

As such, I have flirted with the idea of making it seem like an accident.  I can try to put on that happy mask again, go about living my life for another few months (and oh I can hardly bear that thought), and end up driving under the influence in my rural neighborhood (less chance of hurting someone else) and hitting some tree, most likely (the uncertainty of this example kills me) causing my death.  Then I'm dead just because I'm an idiot.  My parents have told me a thousand times to never drink and drive.  My friends do not know me to ever drink, so they would not blame themselves for not stopping such an occurrence.   Then again, I am a coward.  I don't think I'll do it. 

I want to, though.  Each day is so full of pain. 

I might edit this later.  I'll probably delete it eventually. ",suicide

im going to dump what im thinking and feeling in this post, cuz why not? im kinda anonymous anyway, so, if you wanna say your opinion or give me any kind of advice, i appreciate it, thank you.


when did it all start?
well, i never had any problems developing as a toddler, except for being kinda alone for, well, pretty much all my life, so yeah, that counts as a factor for being depressed, right?

""that doesnt seem like enough to be depressed."" 
uhh, yeah, it isnt, for me at least.

So, what else adds into my mental state?
Long story short, my dad. He's been an alcoholic ever since forever. I remember when i was like 5 and he came home, drunk. I remember all the times he would drink about a liter of 40% liquor in a day, causing a lot of stress on everyone at the house. I remember when he would lash out on my mom (verbally), and they would have a fight while i just stood there, paralyzed and shocked, and somehow, the next day everyone would pretend nothing happened. I remember my mom crying on my shoulder while i stood there, with a thousand things going through my head. So, yeah, oh, how could i forgot my trauma from 2yrs ago, where they almost got divorced and my heart was racing. I hate my dad. I despise him. I just want to fucking stab him in the back about a couple hundred times for all the times he hurt me, my mom, my sis or my brother. 

For me that seems like a lot, but somehow not enough (?) To be depressed. But, however, there's more.

Well, this my sound stupid or/and completely idiotic but i hate doing chores. My mom is always pressuring me to do something, but, she doesnt know that im depressed, so, its not really her fault, i guess.

Another factor that contributes to it: school
Yeah, what a fucking surprise.
Basically, i'm in a new school and it was super stressful for me. I hate waking up, feeling just as fatigued as before and pretending everythings ok. Tbh,ive said shit to my classmates like: ""im going to kill myself this week"", or ""i wish i was dead"", they didnt care, its not their problem anyway. i have a scholarship and getting good grades on all my tests is mentally... i just want to give up. its so frustrating to not understand the subject youre given and fail the test, therefore failing my mom, the only person i try to impress, and i still fail. 

Role models in my life/Getting help
The only person ive ever really looked up to and the only person i admire is my brother. hes a really nice guy and the only one that i trusted (other than my online friends) to talk about my
 feelings. However, i havent been fully honest to him, because i just dont want to scare him or anything like that. my sis is another person that could help me. Why? She's a psychologist, and therefore would probably understand me. Why wont i just go and tell my parents? well, im scared of their reaction.

Suicide
Why havent i killed myself yet? Part of that is that i know my family would be devastated, and the other part? I dont know. I just think about what ive gone through and what i wouldnt have experienced if i killed myself.

yeah, thats all i can think about now.

55437,"Suicide being logical?First of all: Apologies for my English. Didn't really speek it since I graduated from school last year. 

Does anyone know the idea of suicide being kind of logical, when it's like the only reasonable way of thinking about your future? Since I've gratuaded from school last year I tried to work in a supermarket and started to study a subject which I really liked at that time. Started with my driver's licence, too. First, I stopped working because I got more nervous (and tired at the same time) with every shift. Then I skipped more and more classes at my university and eventually stopped going there at all. Around that time I got my driver's licence, but due to me being nervous I never got to drive that much to get some practice. I basically cut off every ""duty"" that forced me to leave the house and interact with people and therefore it developed into a cicle and my ""anxiety"" (souds kind of weird to use this term, but I can't find a better description of being extremely worried about everyone and everything and having no energy to do something about it at the same time) got even worse. Now I'm starting to meet friends more often again and I made up a plan of other classes I could visit at my university (e.g. to change subjects), but now I've got chest pain which makes it nearly impossible to work out and my motivation for visiting other classes slowly fades away. I'm more and more aware of the fact that everything I put my energy into basically goes to shit in the end. No progress in working out, still not a sign of social skills or self respect though I try to interact with friends (or even strangers) as much as possible. I think I let my parents down every time I don't have the energy and/or courage to do something important (although they seem to be interested and understanding they're both extremely stressed at the time). Never had a girlfriend at the age of 19. Had this, whatever it was, with a girl for about 1,5 years, in the end, she was just disappointed and I was hurt and felt kind of used. Regular problems of a regular person, especially considering my age, but I feel like I'm simply to weak to live with it, let alone do anything about it. To be honest, I just can't see me overcoming those ""fears"" or ""problems"" in the near future. Finding a subject I'm interested in, get a nice body, lose my fear/stress about everything/everyone, get a healthy relationship. I just can't imagine me being capable of solving any of these problems. I may sound like an extreme coward (atleast that's what I think it seems like), but before I hurt/disappoint anyone else or get hurt/disappointed (mostly by myself) once again, I think it would be the best - and in this case most logical - way to just end it when there's no sign of something getting better in the near future. I'm not even whiny or over-emotional at this point (which I'm often enough, believe me), it just sounds like the least ""annoying""/stressful way to solve all my problems at once.

254583,"random noiseI don't have anyone to share this with, so reddit, you can have it. 
I am having a hard time right now, so I thought I might write this. Get some of these unpleasant and unsettling feelings out of my head. There has been a strong longing for death feeling squatting around my head. 
When I try to analyze this feeling, I always come back to 2 conclusions. 

1. The existential point of humanity does not exist or can't be known
2. I do not gain joy from the act of working on a task. 

I genuinely believe my brain only receives reward chemicals at the successful completion of a task. Here I am, a seemingly highly intelligent person, and I just feel helpless to really deliver on my own potential. Yet this isn't really about having external observers recognize and praise me. I feel to the very core of my existence, that I am a truly gifted and intelligent person. I feel like a retarded genius. Left to my own devices, I am without action, unable to leverage myself against life. So I am only motivated to action by external events. I feel that there was a small slice of time, very soon after I started transition, that this curse was lifted. I raised myself long enough to get myself surrounded by the external force of Education. I have been riding this wave of aliveness for a number of years now. I don't know where I am going with this. I have lost the metaphor. What I am trying to say is that the external force enacted on me at work requires that I push myself. That I take action of my own accord. Doing this makes me want to die. I know now why I have languished my life away. Because participating in life is depressing. We work for nothing. We accomplish nothing. Yet, our potential is un-measurable. I can not unify these two emotions. The bleakness of our empty existence, knowing that there must be a way for humanity to unify and overcome this. We are our only saviors from ourselves. This is why I don't want to be alive anymore. Because I can't even save myself. I am tired of fighting my own bullshit. The whole thing just makes me want to not think, to not feel, to not act, anymore. I don't know how to make this stop. This is not how I want to feel. Alas, I don't know how I want to feel, or perhaps I could get myself there. Right now, I just feel stuck.",suicide

4761,"insensitive to things you don't understandBefore I begin, I can't speak on behalf of my entire community. I'm also not the best at typing out complete thoughts.
I'm a transgender male. I have crippling dysphoria. Not everyone's dysphoria is at the same level as mine, but every transgender person deserves the same respect towards their identity.
I don't consider myself mentally ill by having my condition. I have depression and anxiety that stem from my condition, but being transgender isn't a ""mental illness"" and if anything it's a medical condition that needs treatment, which would be hormone replacement and surgery without it being considered cosmetic choices. Some transgender people are mentally ill for other reasons, and they still deserve the same respect. 

Here's why I'm putting this here. I am so uncomfortable in my body. Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and want to slit my throat because I don't have an Adam's apple like my dad, and that's no where near the worst of what I deal with on a daily basis. I literally want to kill myself because I'm not who I'm supposed to be. There are so many people like me and people still want to dismiss it as us being delusional, disgusting, mentally ill humans who need therapy to be comfortable with ""who we are already"". The thing is, that doesn't work. Nothing is going to stop how we feel. 
Why not accept us transitioning to help us feel just a bit more comfortable with ourselves? What do you possibly get from refusing to respect someone's pronouns, making fun of someone's plastic surgery, calling a transwoman a man in a dress? Why is another human's pain and struggles funny to you? Because you're dehumanizing us for it and trivializing our struggles because you can't even begin to know and realize how it feels. So many trans youth are killing themselves because their parents don't accept them and today's society doesn't treat them seriously. It makes us feel sometimes that we don't have a future. I watch gay marriage become legal where I live and I'm glad, but I still see transpeople, especially trans women of color, get murdered and I see people calling Caitlyn Jenner a freak and I just don't understand. What does it matter to you. How is our life affecting you? I'd rather be dead sometimes than think about how many people think I'm disgusting scum of the earth for reasons that don't affect them in any way. When you can sit back and realize how different society is to people like me, you will understand why people like Caitlyn Jenner and the entirety of the transgender and LGBT community as a whole ARE brave for coming out. It's sad that to live our lives comfortably other people seek to make them even harder for no reason. I want transgender people, especially the young ones who aren't getting the chance to live freely, to stop having to kill themselves because they aren't getting the attention, love, and treatment they need. It makes me sick. As bad as I want to kill myself sometimes, I want to be here for others who are dealing with the same thing and sometimes that's the only thing keeping me going.",suicide

175879,"Don't know if there's a point in posting but I suppose I've got nothing to lose.I tried to kill myself a few months back, basically to avoid being a burden on society because I can't do anything right. I was in the psych ward for a week. I got out. I'm supposed to be better now, and for a while I was, with the exception of an apathetic outlook on life.

A few weeks ago, our door got stuck shut when my cat was outside. I could have gone out through the garage to get him, but I was tired and not the most logical, so I opened the window that was next to the door and tried to lift the screen out. It wouldn't come out, so I forced it out and bent the frame in the process. Now it's unusable.

My mom said she wasn't mad, but told me to be more conscientious next time. She was frustrated though, but seemed quick to forgive me for acting rashly.

Today I told her about how our cat couldn't figure out which door to use when I called him in, even though he could see me, sort of as a humorous anecdote I guess because our cat is really dumb. But she started going on about how she was irritated that I was acting thoughtlessly and cost her a screen, and that she didn't know where to get one and how I never have to accept consequences for my actions because I'm not a responsible adult. I told her I was really tired and not thinking clearly. She told me, ""Sometimes you have to think clearly.""

She asked me to load the dishwasher and went upstairs. Well of course during this time all I had to think about was what a fuck up I am, and kept imaging vivid images of my arms covered in cuts and bleeding profusely because that's just what I think about when I feel guilty. She came downstairs and asked me if I had any plans today, but I couldn't answer because I was trying not to cry. Then she figured that I was upset, and asked me why. After a long pause I told her that I didn't know she was still upset about the screen.

Then she told me about how she had taken years to learn mindfulness, and it just drove her crazy that she had to see all these people go around and make stupid decisions without even thinking. After ranting for a bit, she said she was furious that I went back to my dad's, even after she'd given me this opportunity to have a better life. I couldn't tell if she meant the last time I lived with him or a few days ago when I didn't feel well and stayed with him because my appointment was near his house and I didn't feel like driving back (would have been an hour drive), but I didn't ask.

Then she went on about how until I learned to do things for myself, I'd be a burden, either on her or society. She said it takes a lot of practice to be that mindful and to realize what the right choices are, but that every time I get close I just ""throw it all away"" because I want to be a victim or something. She again referred to me choosing to live with my dad (he's controlling and abusive). She mentioned how I can't stay in school and that I'll probably fail the next time I try because I haven't improved.

I don't know if this is her odd way of motivating me. She said I should use these criticisms to realize what's going on and work hard to change. But I've been in therapy since getting out of the hospital to do just that. I thought I was working on changing.

She said she was irritated about the window, but that it wasn't about the window. She asked if I could accept why she was upset. I didn't answer.

The whole time it just made sense to me that I'm a fuck up and she thought of me as a burden. Everyone probably does. I tried to kill myself before because whenever I tried to change that, whether that be by holding down a job or going to school, I failed or was completely miserable. So I could be miserable not being a burden or make other people miserable by being a burden, which would also make me miserable, or I could just kill myself now and spare everyone and myself all the misery.

I don't know why I'm writing this, other than to just get my thoughts out there. Or maybe there's another solution and I just haven't thought of it because I'm just a thoughtless zombie burden. I'm not sure. All I know I that I hate my life and I'm no longer attached to its existence.",suicide

81849,"How to be an abusive spouse and parent during a pandemicNOTE: This list is perennially a work in progress.

1. Refuse to participate in raising or caring for your own child.

2. Refuse to leave the house.  Refuse to cook, clean, shop, do yard work, or even so much as to offer feedback or suggestions when your spouse is ordering groceries for you (which you also refuse to do).  Refuse to eat what your spouse cooks for you, while also refusing to either cook for yourself or say what you *would* like for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Offer only criticism and attacks, never support or relief or even an indication of what you actually might want except ‚Äúnot that.‚Äù

3. Steal food from your child‚Äôs plate while your child is trying to eat.

4. Log in to work so infrequently and miss so many of your own deadlines that you get formally written up for it by your own company (of which you are a co-owner), while at the same time insisting that your employees should be required to physically report to the office ahead of the already-reckless schedule you insisted on.

5. Berate your spouse for not having a job while providing no support and taking up no slack so your spouse can either look for one or realistically work at one, since daycares are still closed *and* you refuse to actually look after your own child *and* you won‚Äôt cook, clean, shop, or do yard work either.

6. Constantly demand sex while also refusing to initiate it.  Angrily swat your spouse away every time your spouse tries to initiate as well.  Clumsily grab at your spouse‚Äôs crotch at 3:00 am and initiate some low-key spousal rape every couple weeks or so, and then berate your spouse for not violently resisting while half-asleep and unable to comprehend what was going on.  Make your spouse responsible for managing and assuaging your performative guilt.

7. Lock yourself in the bedroom when your own child wants to play with you and is bawling and pounding at the door, begging for your attention.  

8. Statistically, odds are you will occasionally do something that is intended to benefit your child.  If and when that happens, write it down in the way that makes you look the most like a selfless martyr, then exaggerate it a couple steps more, then lord it over your spouse at literally any opportunity that you can. That one time you went grocery shopping in February 2019 and forgot your wallet, for instance, becomes ‚ÄúI did *all* the shopping in February, and it was so much that I had to make *two trips*!‚Äù 

9. Whenever your spouse brings up your behavior and asks for specific changes or even help with just one thing, literally any one thing, berate your spouse for not going to that one specific therapist you keep pushing so very hard.  Demand that your spouse change medication or doses (note: refuse to watch your own child if and when your spouse *does* make an appointment to discuss medication changes, and scream with inchoate rage if your spouse attempts to take your own child to the appointment with them since you can‚Äôt be arsed to parent).  Never miss an opportunity to turn a request for *you* to change *your* behavior into a spiteful referendum on your spouse‚Äôs mental health.

10. Take your own medication so infrequently and at such irregular doses that, on those days that you take *what* you‚Äôve been prescribed at the *dosage* you‚Äôve been prescribed it and at the *time* you‚Äôve been told to take it, you feel nauseated and spend the whole day bedridden.  Refuse to speak to your own doctor about any of this, and berate your spouse for ever daring to ‚Äúinterfere‚Äù with your medication in any way.

11. Address as few problems, irritations, or conflicts in the moment as possible.  The best time to bring something up is approximately three weeks after the fact, while your spouse is in the middle of doing something wholly unrelated.  In order to compensate for the length of time since the original incident, increase your original rage and vitriol by fifteen percent, compounded daily (you should therefore be approximately 18 times as mad as when the thing that set you off originally happened, if you‚Äôve waited the minimum 21 days).

12. Stop showering.  Stop bathing. Stop shaving.  Stop brushing your teeth.  Stop wearing *clothes* most days, to the point where it‚Äôs more likely than not that you‚Äôve done an employee‚Äôs performance review over Zoom completely naked and with breath so bad *they* could smell it.  But least be sure to tell your spouse how *they‚Äôre* the ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù one.

13. Find new and creative ways to tell your spouse how fat, ugly, lazy, stupid, selfish, and mean you think they are.  Don‚Äôt just say it either; anyone can just *call* their spouse a fat slob, so that won‚Äôt do.  You should be able to, in a completely darkened room, let your spouse know *exactly* which of their features you find disgusting without uttering a *single* word.  

14. For bonus points, you can then berate your spouse for taking any measures to rectify these supposed flaws, but this is not ideal in the long run because you never want to give your spouse any sort of path out.  The ideal follow-up to a ‚Äúdark-room-disgust‚Äù maneuver is to simply roll over and start snoring.

15. If you don‚Äôt like how your spouse is loading the dishwasher (note: you do not do the dishes, ever), go ahead and grab the plate from your spouse‚Äôs hand and smash it on the floor.  Shove your spouse against the wall and just scream.  If your own child is in the kitchen with the two of you while this is going on, you may speak to your own child in a wavering sing-song voice but under no circumstances should you remove your hands from your spouse‚Äôs throat while doing so. 

16. Blame your ‚Äúoutburst‚Äù on your spouse‚Äôs perceived lack of medication.

17. Refuse to add either your spouse or your own child to your better and cheaper insurance plan until after your spouse‚Äôs personal checking account is down to its last $40 from making COBRA payments.  Threaten to take that $40 as well when you finally do add them.

18. Spend two entire months telling your spouse what a garbage person they are because you had to add them to your insurance, even (especially?) if it is cheaper than the COBRA plan you made them bankrupt themselves on.

19. Lie about having added either of them to your insurance, so that your spouse gets a very unpleasant surprise at the pediatrician‚Äôs office.  Scream at your spouse for ‚Äúwasting [your] time‚Äù calling you because you only gave them enough cash for the copay and not the full uninsured cost of a two-year physical and COVID test.

20. Refuse to add your spouse‚Äôs name to your personal checking account or open a joint account, even though *that* just happened.

21. When your spouse‚Äôs car breaks down, refuse to pay for repairs and demand that your spouse donate it to your favorite radio station instead.  

22. While still refusing to do any of the grocery shopping or take your child to any appointments or any activities, hide the keys to your car and prohibit all forms of food delivery services.  Refuse to ever hand your spouse your checkbook, credit card, or ATM card as well.  Turn every routine grocery shopping trip into a high stakes planning, budgeting, and negotiation exercise where your spouse must figure out *exactly* how much it will cost to feed you all this week, spend an hour trying to convince you they numbers are legit, rebut and improvise around you finding lower prices ... *somewhere* (at a store across town or in another city, for instance), trust that you will either go to the ATM or wire money when you actually say you will, and then try to salvage things when you give them less than half of that.  

23. Don‚Äôt just tell your *spouse* how how fat, ugly, lazy, stupid, selfish, and mean you think they are.  Tell *everyone* how how fat, ugly, lazy, stupid, selfish, and mean you think your spouse is.

24. Denigrate your spouse‚Äôs emotions, concerns, health, and contributions to the family at every opportunity.  Make sure to *loudly* tell everyone you talk to how much your spouse is ‚Äúlooking forward to napping‚Äù when and if daycares finally reopen.  Say you ‚Äúmight allow‚Äù that, but that your spouse ‚Äúreally needs to find a job‚Äù so they can ‚Äúpull [their] own weight again.‚Äù  Do this even after your spouse asks you to stop and says why it bothers them.  *Especially* after they ask you to stop.

25. Is your spouse looking at their phone for any reason?  Grab it!  Read their emails.  Read their texts.  Grill them over their search history or why there isn‚Äôt one.  Make them tell you what they were about to google, then google it ‚Äúfor‚Äù them and toss the phone at them and stomp away.  Respond to emails and texts ‚Äúfor‚Äù them without their permission, then delete the threads and leave them guessing who even tried to contact them just now.

26. Did I mention yelling?  Because you should be yelling more.  Yes, even more than that.  Yes, really.  You should aim for 3-5 howls of primal fury every week.  You should scream so often and so violently and about *literally any damn thing* that your spouse has a panic attack and starts reflexively apologizing and bracing for another slap even if you just coughed.  

27. Whenever your spouse does this, *that is also an excuse to yell*.  See numbers 9 and 14-16, above, for suggestions on what to scream at your spouse about.  Above all else, as you ball your fists in white-knuckle fury and pin your spouse against the wall again, remember to blame them for being afraid of you.  As you close your hands around their throat and start shaking them, in full view of your child, say ‚ÄúI am not your enemy.‚Äù",suicide
169583,"I do not feel irrational but I do want to end my life.I can't help but believe that ending my life is the rational decision.  The fact that I'm unable to is an irrational decision based on fear and instinct.  I hate my life.  I hate myself.  I do not want to get better, I just want my life to end.  I've had 33 years of trying to get better, trying to change but I don't.  I'm as lonely, sad and pathetic now as I was when I was a teenager, except perhaps more so because I have almost no hope left when I had maybe a small amount back then.   Hope is really cruel, it makes you not kill yourself when it would have been for the best.  I spent 2 months in a mental ward after my last attempt, I tried pills, meditation, and stutpid crap to try and get better but  4 years later I am still me.  There is not one time since that attempt that I do not wish I had not woken up and only the fear of being incarcerated in that place made me try to fight it.  At no point was I glad to be alive,  I am mostly pissed off that I survived.  I vowed that the next time I would jump from the 9th floor of my building so as to guarantee.

But I am a coward, unable to do it, unable to seek help except this stupid plea in the dark, anonymous.   I write these in the hopes of finding the courage to actually jump.  But I never do, and that is just the failure cherry on my life.  I can't help but feel the world would be a better place without me in it and I better off with ending.  But their is always that fucking shred of hope that makes me think maybe... maybe i'll lose 200 pounds, maybe i'll make a connection with another human maybe i wont always wallow in lonelynes and despair.  That shred of hope keeps me alive and I hat e it for that.  I want to exitinguish that last bit of thinking that things might get better so that I can end.  I'm so tired of being me. I'm so fucking disgusting, I really wish I had the courage to end.  Every fucking day without fail i think I should kill myself.  You think their would be a day where my outlook would be better but anytime I give myself time to think I plan my death,  so i try to drown out my thoughts with books and video games and movies but anytime i have time to think...   Anyways that's how i feel tonight,  I'm closer to the brink then most nights but I don't think I have the courage to end it today.

My name is Angelique, I'm fourteen years old, and I don't know what to do anymore.

My life has been so messed up. I know that is harsh, and I know people have been through much more than me, but I am in **so much pain.** 

I won't go into detail right now, maybe another time, but everything is so hard right now.

I feel like I'm never going to be happy. Ever.

I started cutting at the age of nine, and since then I have done so much to myself, that I'm  not entirely sure who I even am anymore.

I just want to cry, or scream.

I want to fall asleep and never wake up.

I don't want to be here, but I'm not sure if I want to die.

Dying is such a terrifying thought to me, or, I guess, sad. 

The fact that one I am dead, I am dead, is horrible. I don't want to hurt my parents, because deep down I know it would break them to pieces, but, I'm not sure what to do anymore.

92689,"I ruined a frienship...  

So my best friend(F) and I(M) had an argument.

It started when we were gonna play Among Us and get some friends as well. I own a pair of nice Turtle Beach headphones that I've had for 3 years, with 3 years, things that are used tend to wear down. In this case my audio jack decides to make everything very faint and i have to twist and move it in the audio port to hear things clearly. So i say I can't hear her and ask her to speak louder. I repeat this until i realize its my headphones and by then she's yelling at me telling me that I'm cheap and should just buy news ones. I have never seen this side of her before and i was just quiet from shock. Then she starts screaming at about how one of her deceased parents birthday was 2 days ago and that she's really sensitive right now. I had no clue. Then she starts talking about how she has this shit head of a brother and that her dad doesn't care about her. I told her I hadn't seen my dad in months he live on the other side of the country and as my parents are divorced, and that every time I see him we get close and will connect and that when i go back to my moms all of that work will be ripped away and then i wait another 6 months. She said how can that compare to your parent being dead and i was just silent. She then hung up.

I talked to her the day after and apologized for what happened. she said alright I forgive and moved on. Then at about 7:30 pm i had a BSA scout call. So i log into that and then I'm in the meeting and about 30 minutes in a hear them talking. It scared the living shit out of me. Later i realize I hadn't left discord all the way and was in a voice call, I text her friend whos in the call what the actual fuck is happening, In hindsight that was a overreaction and I apologized. I call her the next day, and no answer. Repeat for 3 days. On the 3rd day she texts me what do you want and i say I'm checking in because i haven't heard from her. She had invited me over for a BBQ this weekend at her house. I ask if she's ok and she says ask her friend. then she tells me that she doesn't think that we should be friends anymore since i was rude to her friend. I say hold up what happened during that zoom call really caught me off guard and looking back was a overreaction. I told her that I was sorry for what happened during the headphone incident and that i respect her situation and her feelings. I was cooking dinner at the time so my responses were 1-2 minutes late. She says i need to apologize to her friend who i already had MULTIPLE TIMES and got no response. She says i don't care how people feel which i really do as I'm a people pleaser. she says I'm done talking to you and to leave her alone while telling me to kiss her ass scumbitch. I say I don't understand I've apologized SO MUCH. She thinks that all i care about is the BBQ and I told her I care about the friendship more. She says her friend agrees with her and blocks me on all the apps we share. I woke up at 3 am not knowing what to do and decided i will email her. I emailed her today telling her that what she did made no sense as i had done everything right and that she was being rude and ignorant.

BAD.There's alot to this story and I don't have much time before I have to go get him from work and won't have internet, so I'm just going to kind of put it in as small of a nutshell as I can. 

My boyfriend and I have been best friends for almost ten years. We just recently started dating again after he broke up with his baby's mother. She is now making his life a living hell. She blows his phone up day and night LITERALLY constant bullshit about how terrible he is, how she's fucking other dudes to hurt him, and how she's going to replace him as a father to their four month old son. She's refusing to let him see his son as well and it's killing him. She shows up at his house, calls, texts, etc all day, all night, repeatedly. He's had a lot of bullshit go on in his life and he literally has NO one here for him but me. He's in a terrible place mentally. This morning he called me and told me he was really in a bad place and didn't think he could stay away from his gun. Luckily I got to his house in time, but he'd taken three valium, three xanax, muscle relaxers, a bottle of nyquil and had a few beers. He was beyond fucked up. He slept it off next to me all day and I made sure he wasn't going to do anything stupid, and when he woke up he didn't remember anything that had happened. He's still telling me his mind is in that place and he won't listen to me when I tell him to cut contact with her. I don't know what to do, and I can't leave him alone, but I can't keep trying to keep his head and mine above water when he won't listen to me. I also suffer from depression and I'm worried I don't have what it takes to fix this. I don't know what to do.

267279,"a little about meFirst of all, sorry for my english, because it isn't my native language and I taught myself it from the internet.

I was born at the near-end of the 20th century. Since i was a little child, i can't ever get past ""problems"".
First of all, i was raised in a loud environment since i was a baby to i was about 6 years old. My father would shout at my mom all the time. Not physical hitting tho, but shouting like crazy. I was raised in that environment, and that maybe that affected my mind.
Since I was 2-3 year old baby, many people consider me as ""genius child"", because I was able to count to 50 at 1,5 years of age and tell all the colours (lol, what a genius !). I learned to speak relatively early, and I can still remember being a baby. I remember my memories when I was 3 years old.
But I wasn't a genius. I was just relatively smart, and wanting to think and asking questions all the time. But, because of people's and my mom's defining me as a genius, I was considering myself as a very-clever when I was a child. This ultimately resulted as a devastatingly-huge disappointment when I saw and met genius childs, and despite knowing I am not best mind on the planet, I cannot accept it on my subconsciousness, for example, seeing Marco Arturo on the internet (you can search him) recently resulted me again same disappointment.
And I often will use knowledge and intelligence as same meaning on this post, so when I say geniusness or anything like that, consider both meanings, because both of them result same disappointment for me.
As i said, I have a curiousity about science and philosophy, I love biology (Evolution, Taxonomy, Animals; especially Dinosaurs), planets/universe, technology, history (world history, human history), philosophy, religions/roots and history of religions, civilizations (especially ancient ones), psychology/human behavior, public gender roles/taboos, ethical values.. I love to know more and more, and crave for knowing things. But, I have a huge downside; laziness.
Even a topic I absolutely love to think of, if time has come to gather information on that topic for more knowledge, I become a snob shit. I get bored on that about second paragraph or so. And, even tho I can remember my babyhood, I cannot remember aftermath of it. I cannot remember anything and forget many things that happened except my baby times. And It also can affect my knowledge gathering adventures since sometimes even if I taught so much things to myself, I can forget it all of them, and my time will go wasted. Thus, I think I have a very trivial knowledge on many topics but not in-depth on any of them (except philosophy). And again, if some person that is a master at any topic I listed that I am interested to think of, comes and tells me what's true or not, I go crazy out of jelaousity. 

I stopped reading books from my laziness and internet. I readed books like a machine to my mid-puberty years. After that, I addicted to the internet and get lazier.

I cannot empty my mind from thinking. I think all the time, my find is like a complicated trap. I think about my interested topics, I think about my future, I think about aftermath, I sometimes think about more simple things, such as a videogame, but I cannot stop thinking, and It affects my mental health negatively also, because it really gets me exhausted all the time, and I tend to think negatively.

I suffered from extreme social anxiety and phobia since I was 4 or so. It still continues, but very reduced when I got psychological help. When any person approached me to talk and/or ask something, I would breathe heavily constantly when I was a child. I choose to avoid people, I dunno why, but all the conversations I had with people feels extremely stupid. I sometimes think if I am anti-social. When I think a conversation with any person on my mind, I love it, but when it becomes a reality, I get very cringy and blush out of nothing. It feels empty and stupid. Like I said I still have social anxiety, and I think of what I said anything I feel stupid and empty aftermath a conversation, and shame myself because of it. Many times, I don't want to talk with people and even sometimes if I want to talk someone, I cannot find anything to say. It just flies off my mind. Because of that, I only talk with people to answer questions directed to me, since I know what to say in that situation, and people get bored from me easily because of that. I also take people's opinions too seriously and try to fit in. I cannot do ""just ignore them"".

I am also developed a very cowardly behaviour because of the social anxiety. On my school years, I always faced bullying. Always. I avoid arguing with people on face-to-face situation. Even If it is not a deal to many people, I avoid for no reason. I really cannot understand why.

I adopted existensial and moral nihilism as a viewpoint for the world. I cannot enjoy anything (anhedonia), because it feels stupid and empty. I want to do something fun, and think I will enjoy it when I imagine some activity that is fun, but when I do it, I say ""that's it?? Is that I've been wanting for all the time??"" I also cannot understand how people views subjective things as they are objective (for example; art, music, ethical values, moral values that defines what's wrong or not. If you try to argue with people on these, people will go crazy and direct these subjective things as objective arguments). 

I always tried to be a special person. Knowledge was my approach to this goal. I wanted to be looked with admiration. But since I think like an emo like nihilism manner, I imagined that situation and thought again as ""Was that I've been trying to do?"" It also feels empty. I currently think no one is special from one another, no matters how you're intelligent, has knowledge, has ability to produce music that eveyone admires, how beautiful you are.. Once you're dead, it means nothing. All your effort/luck will gone. Freddie Mercury died and all of his consciousness gone forever. It means not nothing yet, people still admiring him but eventually he will be forgetted. And his existence will mean nothing. We will die after about 80 years and we mean nothing. We are just one of the unimportant part of huge universe. I cannot understand people's lifetime goals and what they trying to do on their lives. Why? We're just little part of a giant self-recycling system.

I'm having really hard time writing this because like I said, I cannot remember anything. It's like a notch toned down alzheimer. I forget everything and I just forgot what I am considering depressing.

Let's get on my sexual behavior. I am not heterosexual, that's for sure, but I cannot define myself as any of the LGBT community's binaries. I cannot %100 fit any of their binaries (gay, bi, trans etc). I think I am trans, but my phychologist says It could be caused by sexual fetishes and asks me to imagine being a woman and says if I think I will be comfortable in that gender. I also fear of bein g trans, since world hasn't accepted fully trans people yet, and I may face bullying, which is one of my worst fears since my school years. Heck, even if I fit to society as undisguisable woman, it's still hard, being woman is harder than being a man. It's also my one of the worst traits, staying off from hard.
First of all, I hate most of males' bodies. It's very rare If I like a male body, but I like male genitalia more than female genitalia. Thus, I'm mainly attracted to trans people (not undergone operation).
Like I said I don't male body, but I absolutely have attraction to female body. And I want to be in a body that I'm attracted to, I cannot understand heterosexual people's attraction to opposite gender while still loving their body. I cannot get it. I also have very large body (tall, large hands, feet, arms and legs) so I'm afraid of the outcome If I gone under hormone treatment. I fear of being a ""freak"", as public's definition. I have many fetishes, Including bondage, bdsm play, denial, feet, dominance over me etc. I see sex as a drug for not thinking at least for a short time about this meaningless world, even if I think when I done it, I also say ""That was it??"". I hate imagining myself in active partner, I love to imagine myself as pasive partner. I've never had sex, (my country is relatively conservative, and I still have social anxiety over me) but I played with toys. Like I said I like male genitalia, and even If I undergo hormone treatment one day, I don't want to undergo uperation, because I cannot think that organ as a ""true"" vagina. Even thinking of it feels really horrid, It's just like Frankenstein's monster. Penis splitted in half and a part of rectum insterted in a place that cutted with knife, on you. I cannot even imagine that situation, and even technology advances one day to make a ""true"" vagina, I doubt I still want it on me, because like I said, I like male genitalia, even if I not use it on as an active partner. I get really jelaous of trans people's stunning bodies, and how they achieved it affects my psychology negatively. I want the same thing!

Sex and playing video games is what I see as partial escape-holes from the world. I play video games and surfing on the internet all the time, about 14 hours a day. I tried going out with people, but, like I said, It felt meaningless.

I considering suicide as an option, but I have no guts for doing it yet. Many time we taugt how bad it is to committing suicide, and how wonderful world is, It's just a quick ending. Everyone will live this ending someday, some are earlier, some are late. I cannot see any single reason why suicide is bad.

Anyways, like I said, my english is really bad,because of that, I cannot express myself better than my native language, and forgive me for my mistakes. Thank you all for reading this long post.

I also see a world turning shittier and shittier with each passing day, and the science seems to back up that assessment.

My glasses were taken away. The world became a blur and so, so terrifying. I've been out for 3 months. The only reason I haven't tried to off myself again is because I'm absolutely petrified of waking up back in that windowless cell. I'm worse than when I went in. Before, all I had to deal with was a chemical imbalance and getting my meds sorted out. 


No I can't go a day without flashbacks, and panic attacks, and crying, and being too afraid to show emotion(I wouldn't have been let out if I showed anything other than being fine and stable and so fucking great) I just feel desolate and I'm always terrified. 


I can only function now when I don't think or feel. I stay distracted. But it's not helping anymore. Every day it gets harder and i know if i start crying and feeling and thinking again I wont be able to keep on going. 

i'll be back in that horrible place, with the urine stained blankets from previous patients/prisoners on the cement floor and nothing but derision from the cruel nurses.

1796,"I think I just made suicidal gesture?Okay, 

So I'm in grad school and it really sucks. I'm really not into the idea of going into academia, but I don't want to quit, I love my discipline and, let's be real, I have nothing else going for me. That said, I can't stand my peers or the faculty, I feel like an idiot most of the time and I cannot get excited about the prospect of taking this any further, given the cost.
I got into a language program that would be great for my CV, but financially speaking, I just can't afford to support myself through the summer. Outside of loans I'm on a shoe string budget as it is and this would ruin what little of my own money I have left. I tell my adviser this and she tells me in so many words that if I don't do this, I will not get my degree. My adviser has been really absent through the degree process and hearing this is really disillusioning.
I have no clue what to do. I don't want to give up my degree, but I really, really HATE my program. If I stay, I'll be miserable, if I go, I'll hate myself for quitting. I know what your thinking, but transferring in grad school is easier said than done. 
Last night, I got into a really big argument with my parents. It wasn't so much about what decision I was going to make and more about the fact that I need to lighten the fuck up and take responsibility for myself. A few hours later, after I got done studying, I was really upset.  I was thinking that I had made an irreparable mess out of this situation and that there was no way out of it. So, I took my belt off, fastened it around my neck, tied it to a rack in my closet, not one high enough off the ground to hang myself and just sat there. I considered tightening the belt enough to try to cut off circulation to my head, but either I didn't think it would work or I chickened out. I don't really know which it was. I took it off and just went to bed.
So, I guess my question is, did I just make a suicidal gesture and what should I do about it? I don't want my parents to worry about me/I don't want to deal the embarassment of any potential fallout from telling anyone about the situation. But, I also don't think  this is something I should brush under the rug.",suicide

236875,"Verge of suicide: head tension degrading my brain, help?!I have never used Reddit before, but since it has such a good reputation of helping people I thought it would be a good idea to ask for help here... 

Question is:
     I have had this head tension in my forehead all my life and adhd symptoms, with that comes depression and social isolation etc,
What is this head tension that doesn't let me focus?

It's like something, a stick is burried into my head.

I can't think.  I have this flicker or memory that I constantly forget what I'm doing at the current moment and that everything exists.
Depersonalization and derealization.
Slowly I have been forgetting my language, (words and grammar syntax) for about all my school years, now in University, though dropout.
I have social anxiety it seems and my memory flicker is so strong that I feel dizzy. Also maybe general anxiety idk. When asked technical questions or I need to do math for all these years I have been getting slower and slower, mentally speaking. Even with stuff that I love like music, I make music. Many times, I'm composing and I can't focus at all to the music nor can't almost see  at the screen as if what I hear and see is blurry and makes no sense. When doing anything tbh. And I can't see or hear things for so much, a second passes and I forget. It's even hard to sometimes listen to people and read even. Because I forget midway where I am,What's happening what or where I'm reading or doing and I get stuck with me as if zoning out and everything becomes like blurry or something. My head constantly hurts with the head tension, as if I was angry and was showing it with my face.  Before when I was young I was supposedly normal. Had many thoughts and could focus as a normal person with ADHD would or could. But now, I can't even do the simplest of tasks, and it's only been getting worse. And I constantly have these instructive thoughts filling my mind to the brim like. You're just making excuses to not work. 
No this is legit I feel odd, wtf is happening I can't grasp myself.
Maybe you're just dumb.
Maybe, but why can't I grasp reality?
Maybe you're just a stupid child. Or wasn't raised properly.

Anyways not such a good example of the instrusive thoughts. 
Because lately it's been that my mind is just completely empty.
Meditating is even easy, because it's as if I have no thoughts.

I can't even write nor make music like I used to because of this. Had to drop out of college because of this, failed two semesters out of three.

It's really like I can't grasp myself and that my brain is literally rotting or shrinking.


A bit of backstory.

I went to school like any normal kid. I was always alone and had no friends, it wasn't till highschool that I began to create my social skills. 

I always needed help from my mother because I couldn't study, which resulted into a lot of fights I the house and me being alone countless hours everyday trying to learn something but not being able to do so. I still remember the rustle of the trees in my room when Young. I almost had no childhood.

Life was, depressed at school then depressed at home. Always since young constantly depressed.  
I was seen by a neurologist that said I might have adhd. 

It wasn't paid attention and nothing was done about it.
I kept like this. Always getting worse. Then at highschool I think or a bit before, the head tension started, I think maybe at middle school.

My attention to what people were saying started degrading, I was forgetting grammar in my language, both Spanish and English. I was horribly depressed it only worsen. And my head really hurt. Memory got worse and well, everything.

Then forward to recent past.  We went to a psychiatris for diagnosing adhd. In July. It went well I got a perfect score. The Adderall really helped me a lot. I went to university again. And slowly the effects of Adderall started to drop as I always was.
Filled with anxiety in the classrooms and with people.

But this time I started having panic attacks as my anxiety got worse and worse throughout the years. I tried to manage it and do well in University, but I kept getting panic attacks. Believing the I might have a trauma of my school years. Then I tried to kill myself in the dorms twice. Went to a psychiatric hospital twice, which didn't help at all. I also have antidepressants that doesn't do shit.  And the second time I tried to kill myself I went to university again to try more. But I got a I think panic attack so strong. That I couldn't move at all, and I was shaking and my whole body was tense, and dizzy and frozen. It got so strong to the point where I couldn't move nor almost talk. I felt like I was loosing conciousnes.  Then when that happened. I was in my hometown at my house for a whole week trembling not being able to talk properly nor think properly. Having as if mental breakdowns of getting insane. And I had to quit university.  And it still keeps on the head tension and mind dying. Not shaking anymore and can walk. I still have panic attacks yes. But not as intense as that one that made me stop moving.

93856,"Hey allI'm back. I didn't go trough with it again. But I set up tomorrow for it. I don't really know why people are writing notes to others. I mean isn't it obvious that you feel bad if you already killed yourself? All I have to say is I love you to the girl I love. I will also send an email to my mom. Sadly I can't call her before. It's weird how killing yourself effects others. I mean I think if they really cared they would at least notice how bad have you've been lately no? I do know that I can hide it very well. But I've been leaving small hints everywhere. Everyone can see them. I've shown off all the places I cut before. But no one noticed. I even tweeted what a final night and no one understood it. I left just black pictures on Facebook. I contacted all the people I used to care about. But how many will remember me after a day? After a week? And after a couple months my parents should be over it. I was an accident. I once was in a fight with my mom and she just slammed that on my face. I love her and I know she never means harm to me and she always loves me. But I don't see the point in living. I moved away from my home country by myself so I could work travel and find myself. But in reality I was just running away from the fact that I'm not meant to be here.

I wish I could be a cloud. Flying above everyone just casting my shadow on them. Some enjoy the little cool breeze that comes with it. Some might want to sunbath and curse at me but I can just roll over. 

I can't think like other people. Well ofcourse I have this feeling of wanting to leave this place but that is just a feeling. I have a weird way to make sentences. I'm bilingual and so I make sentences that make sense but it just isn't normal. I also have the feeling of that I'm not in my body. I have quite a few memories but I can't remember them as seeing from my point of view but I remember them as if I was in a third person game. Following the main character (me) around.

There are nights when I feel like my body is out of proportion. My hands are too big. My hands are too small same with my legs body or head. 

I had a panic attack a little over a week ago. This was the first time in my life. I'm really scared of it now. That night started with just feeling lonely. But then I felt like I could not talk to anyone. I tried calling the girl I love but she was asleep. She woke up but then remembered she had homework and couldn't talk to me. I panicked even more. First I went numb. Then all of my muscles tensed up. I was by myself. I'm always by myself.

This girl I love lives 2000 miles away. I've never seen her in real life. We discussed that we'll meet this summer but it seems like she won't be able to. I can't stand it. I just rely on her too much. I will suffocate her if I continue down this path. I know it will hurt her when she hears about it but I know she is very strong and she will have an amazing life once she forgets me. 

It's not hard for people to forget me. I've never had a friend for more then a month year. And the people I used to be close to now are just distant memories. My only redeeming quality was that I thought I was nice. But it turned out I'm cynical according to the person I love. So there is nothing good about me.

I'm 20 years old. I've had a girlfriend for 2 weeks. I don't even think she was my girlfriend. I don't really mind that fact. It's more like a proof of people won't like me. I used to go out a lot. To tell you guys the truth I love people. I love to meet people. But people don't love me. I'm not a person compatible with others. 

If you have read this far you are the best! Thank you for being here and looking out for people like me. Yiu guys are doing great work for everyone who has no other place to turn to. I think people like you give a chance for the future of humanity. Doing something out of passion just because you feel it's the right thing. I admire you. And I have to say. I envy all of you a lot. I wish I could be someone like that. But my life shall end tomorrow.

I hope if there is afterlife I can be a cloud. I can roam the world and never worry about anything. Thank you for reading this book length letter. ",suicide

I will get straight to the point. My dad is an abusive asshole. He has struck me twice with my mom's stilettos, and even a metal rod. He says things like ""I should have killed you at birth"", ""You are the greatest failure of my life."" and other bullshit.

Since childhood, I have heard all these abuses hurled at me, but as I started growing up, my anger grew. Yesterday, as I was sitting in my room, He asked me to shut shut off the door, I was scrolling through my reddit feed and I could not notice him. He came at me and was about to slap me when I took a pen and drove it into his armpit. As he whimpered in pain, I ran away and locked into my room. Later today, he had cooled off, but I feel I have a ticking bomb in my own house. It's to the point I have to keep a pocket knife with me at all times. I fear he would take out my retaliation on my mother or sister.

I asked my mother to divorce him, she says my sister needs dad for her proper development. I tried to call police, but was stopped by mom. I feel conflicted about reporting my own dad to the authorities. He explicitly threatens to kill me and my sister. I live in constant fear about it.

141157,"Suicide feels like ""sooner or later"" option and I can't find any excuse to make it push it until ""later""I'm twenty-two. I'm trans. This week marks a year since I started HRT, and it doesn't feel like a milestone, an accomplishment, or anything at all. It just feels hard, and I feel utterly numb and empty. 

I guess I've been ""passively"" suicidal for ages, but for the last six months or so I've come to terms with the fact that I'm either going to kill myself now, or later. Right now, I don't see the point in dragging the rest of my life out any longer than it needs to be. There's nothing fulfilling about pursuing a  useless liberal arts degree. Or working at a shitty dead-end IT job. Or being constantly broke and hungry. All I do in my free time and otherwise is smoke weed and watch TV and read. It's not life. It's existing, poorly. My parents don't like me - at best, I'm an annoyance. At worst, I'm an embarrassment, the topic no one brings up at Christmas - or any other time, for that matter. My friends are great people. I love then, but I can't deal with being a burden to them. In a weird, fucked-up way, It makes more sense to put people through the pain of dealing with me killing myself than it does to force them to endure my weakness, my neediness, my complete inconvenience of an existence. I hate myself so utterly and totally that I find it difficult to imagine that others won't eventually reach the same conclusion.

I don't want to be another statistic, another depressed trans person that ends up killing themselves. But I'm such a fucking cliche otherwise that I know it's come to that. I've been depressed for nearly ten years. I've been in therapy. I've been medicated. The whole thing. None of it helps. Cutting used to make me feel better, and lately it's all I can think about. I look at other guys my age and I know that I'll never really fit in with them- I'll never fall in love or get a job or meet someone or function like a normal fucking human being. I'm awkward and ugly and completely pathetic. No matter what I do. I've spent years trying, sometimes very fucking hard, too hard, and I have nothing to show for it. Nothing. I feel tremendously guilty for putting everyone around me through it all and coming out of it empty-handed and just as fucking lost as I was before. I've alienated friends, family, people who showed me nothing but kindness and acceptance. Because I'm a selfish asshole. Well - I don't want to be that way. I don't to do this anymore. 

I'm afraid of being completely transparent with anyone I know irl because it always feels like I'm obliging people to talk me out of it. I don't want to be talked out of it. If this is life, if this is what it's going to feel like, then I don't want anything to do with it. I'm so tired of being tired. Of feeling utterly numb and alone, even though people love me and care for me. I'm so sick of existing as a waste of a human being. 

I guess I'm just posting this to get it out of me. I've thought about leaving a note but it always ends up sounding rote or melodramatic or sanctimonious or just... flat. Empty. So thank you very much to anyone who took the time to read this.

In April, I was let go from my job. I was promised I'd be kept on at the end of the business's season, and allowed to start training for a higher position, I was however lied to, and like a said, ultimately laid off.

I have a GED, and my A+ Certification under my belt, and after looking in my gmail sent box last week, I've estimated that I've made about 150 calls, and sent out over 800 resumes via emails, still nothing.

I applied for unemployment, food stamps, and medicaid for my pregnant wife, and now almost 3 yr old daughter. I was given all three... but the unemployment payments were and still are very very little. I get about 150 a week. Our food stamps are enough to keep us fed. But the unemployment has mainly gone to pay our electricity, and buy needed items for our daughters, diapers/blankets/clothes etc...

My wife gave birth to our second daughter last week, and I couldn't love any of my ladies more. My wife and two daughters are my world... and I'm letting them down.

on the 8th of the month, (3 days past due on 600 dollars of rent) we recived a letter from our landlady... she advised us our lease is up, and she's tired of working with us on being late with rent... she we had til the 23rd to be out, otherwise she'd go through the eviction process. On the day of my newborn daughter's birth, my mother called her and advised her we need more time... she agreed to let us stay til the 31st. 

I have still not paid her for the month of July. And have 3 days to get out of here with nowhere to go, less than 75 dollars, no one available to loan us anything, and no hope of finding available services from the state as i was informed yesterday that waiting lists are 2-4 years long right now.

My parent's don't have money to help, or a place that we can stay. They simply don't. We tried last year before I landed the job I was laid off from in april, and they were threatened with eviction for letting us live there for a little while.

My wife's mother and father are divorced and live in different states. They've offered to help in the past, but only to the extent of helping by giving my wife and daugters a place to stay, not me. My wife refuses to except that offer without me being included.

I'm ready to just... let it all go. To just take a couple more of these pills, and fade out. I really feel like my wife would have more opportunity to succeed in life and with these little girls, if it weren't for my constant failing. We're so close to being homeless... should i just disappear and do it? should I do it tonight when they all goto sleep? will her parents really help her if Im gone? 

I know it would break her heart, and it breaks mine to think about it... but I dont see another way. If we become homeless with nowhere to go... the girls will be taken from us. theyll be split apart and put in homes where people make money from babysitting orphans and call them self foster parents.

I want desperately to fix all of this, but there's no way, I've turned everywhere I can think to. I've exhausted everything. And I'm the only roadblock in her way to getting into a stable environment by her choice alone.

I'm so tired of this.... mentally and physically...

UPDATE:
---------

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. 

I don't really know how to take all of this in... it really is astounding that people I've never met would take the time to care for me and mine. I've received an offer of a financial loan, that should get us into a place, or let us continue where we are. 

I've looked at the links you've provided me, and have already taken steps to get help from some of these programs. 

Most importantly, I've taken the advice of people and realized how devastated I'd leave people where I to act on the things I stated above. I'm actually more ashamed that I can really convey here that I even thought these things, let alone posted them online. 

I told a few of you via IM/Emails/Replies and such that I actually have a meeting with the local mormon church tomorrow night. Hopefully they know of a place that we can get into without me having full time employment right now.

234735,"Suicide as an informed decisionHello, I am 26 and I think I am considering suicide. Not because my life is terrible but I don‚Äôt know what else to look forward to. I spend thousands of pounds on therapy each year, I go weekly and I do my inner work. I think I am spiritually plugged into God and trust that my life experiences are building me up for something. However I don‚Äôt live a Christian life or one I think I should be living. I just don‚Äôt know what is happening or where my life is going. 

When I think about my childhood, the sexual abuse and exposure, the abuse from my parents and the torn self esteem I battle with everyday and this mask I have to put on everyday for the world so that no one knows I am leaking inside... I get nervous. I‚Äôve made progress with therapy, dealing with rejection, depression and loneliness but I have this strong desire to run away. Start afresh. However, my exterior may not make that escapism so sweet so I think about suicide. Surely it is not selfish but maybe like my way of saying I‚Äôm done and no longer want to participate in this world. 

Then I think about my day to day life. I trade in 10-12 hours of my life at a job I am not convinced I enjoy but made myself to enjoy... I successfully unpack all of my psychological shortcomings in therapy and then I feel exposed. Exposed because their is no action on when to close that chapter or revelation so I can just function. Sometimes I day dream about suicide. The thought of not being here and experiencing this. It feels peaceful. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll commit suicide. I am sure of it. However it does look like a very viable option sometimes... I just don‚Äôt know what I am living for and I don‚Äôt know why if I don‚Äôt know what I am living for....why I am living. 

Crazy.

She is no longer interested in listen to me and I can feel she now looks down on me. 

I am not afraid that she will leave me. in fact, I would leave myself if I were her. I am a fucking loser, 7 years of education still not employable skill.

201061,"Not suicidal but seeking help/adviceHi. I'm not really sure where to start with this or what I'm even looking for so I'll just speak my mind and talk about myself. My life has been a trip to say the least. I'm 27, turning 28 next month. I haven't caught a break since I turned 20 and honestly lately I just don't know. When I was 20 I was pretty much at the top of the world. Healthy, strong, body of a model, 160IQ, can program in multiple languages, very fast learner, women flocking to me, pretty much anything anyone could want. Only negative I could thing is I was dirty poor but it didn't bother me. I met someone named Ashley. A blind date setup from my friend Skylar at Hershey Park. I thought she was cute and it was comfortable being around her. She was a cook and specialized in baking. I forget the name of it but she made this delicious pastry that I think had honey in it. It's probably my favorite to this day. We ended up dating and got engaged after a year. After that my heart started giving out, literally. My heart kept seizing, going into afib, and other abnormalities. It put me in the hospital at least every other month half dead and I'd stay weak after. Then by the time I built my strength back up it would happen again and again and again. Doctors would look at me and see a strong young guy then blow me off. I had to practically beg for medicine to be treated. The antiarrythmic medication is what kept me alive. In the middle of this Ashley started having strokes. She had over 10. It changed her. She ended up in a psych ward twice. I was there as much as I could. Only a few times was I not and it haunts me to this day. I don't expect myself to be perfect but still. I could have done more and I know it. Hindsight is something right. Around the 2year mark of us being together I got hurt bad physically and ended up recovering from surgery for a while. During this literally every 2weeks I was having to stop Ashley from us breaking up. Instead of being there for me she did this. After I recovered about a year later we decided to move out of state. I would go first to get us ready and get us a house. Then we would get married. Not even a month apart she sleeps with a guy she just met a pool party. I find this out when I get a random text from her saying its over. I convince her to meet. We drive to eachother. First thing I do is grab and kiss her. So happy to see her. She cries when she kisses me then tells me what she did. She literally slept with the guy while wearing her engagement ring to me. We ended after that. I dated some after that. My mind wasn't in the right place at the time. I just wanted to forget and move on. Wasn't right but I didn't realize at the time. Where I moved had a lot of my family including my elderly mother who I started taking care of. She got very sick and I saved her life on more than one occasion. Couple years later I meet someone at work. I'll only use her initials here, DT. We worked together around 2years, ended up together, and engaged at 3years. She was married. Fcking foolish me fell in love. I believed her story of married the wrong person because of her family, etc... I found out how much I was being deceived and the truth much later. It ended up costing me my job but in my mind she was worth it. I ended up breaking my back at the next job shortly after starting. It literally made me a cripple at the time and almost put me in a wheelchair. I'm still recovering to this day and might have back surgery #3 coming up soon. After I got hurt my fiance DT, I have never seen a case of dr. jeckle and mr. hyde more than in her. She literally abused the hell out of me in every possible way you could think of. I find out what I was told when I got together was a lie. She married the ex because she was after the better life(he had money). She even had an ex's ring with her during there wedding. She got with me for a similar reason. She's been gone for about a year now and I don't want her. The pain from that abuse is still with me to this day. To double it up this all happened while I'm a cripple I find out that my own mother who I've been taking care of because she didn't always get what she wanted. For example if I went out anywhere without her she would give guilt trips because she wanted to always go with. She trashed me so badly to the family that I've literally been thrown away by my whole family. My aunt, uncle, cousins, little cousins, it's gone now. And my only sin was being there when I was needed. Helping when I was needed. I literally have nothing now. My fiance and I had the same friends so they went with her and my own elderly mother I was taking care of took my family. Kick me while I'm down why don't you. To this day I know what happened and I'm not in denial but it's so hard to believe. It's like I'm living in a nightmare. I'm a cripple who lost everything. If you ask anyone who has known me. I've always been kind and strong both physically and mentally. My only weakpoint mentally, which I knew about but considered it ok, was that I open myself to those I care about. Those are the only ones who could hurt me. Nothing else even phases me. Conditioned be my rough life growing up. This betrayal which it would be one thing if I actually did something but all I did was get hurt and at most as for help. This broke me. For the first time in my life I broke. I've pieced myself together very slowly. Tried new hobbies(got into audio and the music helps when I'm hurting physically or mentally). I don't leave the house. Not to keep the world out or anything like that but because of my injury I physically can't. I only go out for dr appointments. Before my last surgery I practically starved myself so I can drop weight. I was actively losing my legs so this was a last ditch effort to slow the deterioration down(. Then after the surgery I've stuffed my face since to help the healing process. It's helped but I'm not healed yet(If I woke up after the surgery without function in my legs I was going to put a bullet in my brain, not just words, I really mean it). I have nothing anymore. I own a house. Paying off my car slowly(workmans comp barely gives enough for the bills). That's all I got. That's it. Every day I'm doing everything I can so I can heal physically and mentally. I want a new life. Every day I just want to put a for sale sign in the front and any little bit of money I'd make if any(a thousand or two at most). Move somewhere and start a new life. Honestly I'm thinking of how I could move to a different country and start truly fresh(I'm in the USA now). If that's not possible probably the west coast then. Benefit of being a nurse is if I heal enough from the injury I can work almost anywhere. If you read this far I want to say thanks.

279323,"I can't handle realityI don't know why I'm writing this. I've never had such a low point in my life. Every day I have countless thoughts on how I want to kill myself, why I want to kill myself. I just want to silence my thoughts. All I ever want to do is sleep because I don't have to face the truth of the situation I'm in. I'm constantly lying to myself. 

The only reason I don't put a rope around my neck is because the first woman I've ever loved left me, And it would break her heart if she thought she was responsible for it. I can't do that to her. I'm constantly lying to myself. Telling myself my relationship with her isn't over and she'll come over tomorrow and everything will be okay. When I met her I was in such a dark place and she pulled me out of it but I put her on a pedestal and convinced myself she was the only thing making me happy. And I still believe that.

54045,"What's the point of music if no one wants to hear it?I'm 22 years old. My passion has always been music, but I can't do anything with that in a backwater town like where I'm from.  Dime-a-dozen ""talent"" and looks. No job, no S/O, no money to move. Yeah, I have relatives I could move in with out of state, but I'd just push my burden onto them. I'm just so fucking envious of people who play mediocre music at best and get so fucking lucky to have success just drop into their lap, meanwhile you can play and try for years and years and get absolutely *nowhere* because you're from a hick-town.

Things have gotten morbid, too. My lyrics have become blatantly about suicide and self harm, my aspiring major at my community college is mortuary science so I could potentially get some sick, deplorable catharsis out of staring at the dead, I'm saving up for a 12-gauge, and I've got a noose tied in my dresser. I'm just too pussy to use it.

I live in the Great Lakes Region currently, one of the lakes is notorious for bodies never being found if you don't know where/don't know they fell in. I figure in wintertime I can get out far enough nobody would ever find my body if I decided to shoot myself into an ice-fishing hole. I've written my suicide note vague enough that it sounds like I just packed up and moved across the country, so at least anyone I cared about would be spared having to hear I killed myself, they'd just think I went No Contact. (Please tell me this didn't violate the ""explicit methods"" rule)

I'm going nowhere fast and I can't take it anymore. I've decided that if things haven't improved by the time I'm 27, I'm fucking going through with it. My mother says ""what could be so bad that you would"" and I say ""what would be so great that I shouldn't?""

She wanted to keep it a secret so she had only told it 4 people including me. I told her that cutting herself doesn't help and it just makes things worse but she disagrees and says that it helps her. She cuts herself on her wrist I've never seen her do it (she does it alone) and don't know how deep or how much she cuts. But I'm just scared that one day she will go too deep and she'll bleed out. I don't want to lose her and I'm afraid she doesn't see how much she means to me. We are both pretty young but she says that there is no hope for her and she wants to die.

I don't know if I trust myself to stay alive much longer. Everything would've been better if I were never born at all. I only stop myself from following through by thinking about the people that matter to me, but then it hits me that they'll be gone one day too so what does it matter. I'm sick of this never ending cycle. Why am I so emotional, everybody else is handling life just fine, but here I am seriously considering pussying out despite how good life should be for me right now. It's a constant battle of thoughts between everything matters and nothing matters. I hate myself so much, I shouldn't be feeling like this. 
I have people who I can trust to talk to about anything, but I feel so bad for being such a burden. I know they don't mind, but I still can't stop thinking that I'm such a waste. They shouldn't have to hear such depressing shit all the time, I'm such a drag. I could try therapy again, but honestly what difference does it make. Life's just about coping, but I'm sick of putting the effort into anything. My whole life will be a constant battle with these thoughts until I die.

As a forty-something, childless, partnerless woman (not for lack of trying), who likely can no longer breed, who isn‚Äôt particularly successful career-wise...from a social standpoint, I truly feel irrelevant to most of society. What good is a woman if not a young, thin, potential incubator, a mom, a grandma, or someone professionally successful?
And so when I see people under 30 on here, certain life is over...I think...how? You have potential. You can switch careers without getting side-eyed. You aren‚Äôt considered ‚Äútoo old‚Äù to be with. Unless the person is ostracized for a truly incurable disability or other factor that absolutely leaves them permanently on the outside- this I understand- I find myself looking at their situation and I don‚Äôt know how to NOT think ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre so young!‚Äù And that‚Äôs with me remembering being suicidal in my 20s (yet now baffled by that- what was I thinking? As it is, things did not turn out well but still...at the time...there was a chance then! And not everyone will necessarily turn out like me, where suicide makes so much more sense now, and that will likely increase as I age and become more invisible).

I recognize they may have gone through such more awful things than me...but it‚Äôs their potential I just can‚Äôt shake and it always seems to be a knee jerk instinct in my responses. Does this kind of thinking from older people- about potential (again, if they don‚Äôt have some sort of incurable condition that alienates them)- offend younger people seeking to die?

Anyways, I have written a suicide note and come very close to ending it all in the past two days. That's on top of having to chat with a Suicide Hotline about two weeks ago. 

I haven't been this close to suicide in well over a year. The last time though I was crying the entire time and very hysterical. Now I'm just very calm about it. I mean I still don't feel good, but I'm not crying or anything. I'm anxious as all hell, but I am not really feeling anything.

I really feel like I should seek help now, but I'm afraid to. My sister has been in and out of the hospital for things like this, and I don't want to put my parents through all of that again. But I really feel like I'm at risk right now. 

Part of me thinks I'm doing this for attention, but really I'm not. I don't anyone to know. That's why I'm using the obvious throwaway.

I just want to end it all. There's things I want to do, part of who I am, that isn't ever going to be accepted by family. And I just want to die instead of living instead of this mental prison I've created for myself. I really don't know what to do anymore.

Simply put, I‚Äôm not interested in living a full life. I‚Äôm 24 years old (not young, not old, I guess). I‚Äôm pretty much asexual and haven‚Äôt found anything that brings me joy or a remote sense of happiness. I have a dog I love to death but I live in isolation and I can tell it‚Äôs affecting her.

I‚Äôm a burden on my family. My mom helps with rent when student loans and work aren‚Äôt enough. If I‚Äôm struggling in school my brother gives me a call to talk things through.

267086,"End of line 

My race is run. I‚Äôm tired. Tired of my head spinning with memories too horrible to ever settle down. Tired of nightmares whenever I close my eyes. Tired of being afraid to be anything other than alone. Tired of sabotaging my every job and relationship. Tired of hating myself. Tired of the irrational fear and anger that are always just under the surface. Tired of not knowing how to reach out to other people in all those little ways that seem so easy for others. Tired of not knowing how to talk to people, or even beginning to know how to explain this.

I got tired of trying to cover it up by making other people laugh; after a time it became too difficult. Then I covered it up by playing the misanthrope, and now I‚Äôm tired of that.

Some people should have their kids taken from them. I was so young when it happened, when I went numb to my own life and to the whole world. As far back as I can remember there‚Äôs been six inches of cotton between me and the universe. And yet I know I didn‚Äôt start this way. I wasn‚Äôt born the non-functional mess that I am. I was made. If it wasn‚Äôt the violence it was the inhuman screaming. If it wasn‚Äôt the screaming it was the cold disdain and the open hatred. 

My mother made it clear to me from the time I was tiny that my existence was the reason she was stuck in a life she hated. She said this to me clearly and repeatedly. She did everything she could to sabotage my young life. She lied to people, to family, to anyone who would listen about what a terrible son I was. She made things up that I didn‚Äôt do, to make them think less of me. She sent me to school with dirty clothes on purpose, enjoying the fact that this made me a target. When I had birthday money she made me spend it on her. Later she pestered and encouraged me to quit school so that I would be nothing. Anything she could do to harm me, from the scars on my body to the scars in my mind. She was such a hateful, manipulative creature with a different face for everyone.

My father was an endless source of savage violence learned from his own not-childhood and passed on to me. My mother used this fact to hurt me further. Even as she protected my brother - the child she chose to have, the one who had her blue eyes - she would set dad upon me like a weapon. I remember endless times, hearing her whispering lies to him, lies about things I hadn‚Äôt done that day while he was at work, things I hadn‚Äôt said, knowing it would incite him to violence. If I protested I was beaten more for lying, even though I wasn‚Äôt. If I begged I was beaten more for being weak. If I apologized I was beaten more for ‚Äúadmitting‚Äù to whatever made up thing I was being punished for. 

At such a young age, just single digits, I was already a depressed, closed-off wreck of a person. I‚Äôve never truly been functional or OK. I know that now. There was no respite except to escape into my own mind. My life at home made me obviously different from other kids, and that made me a target at school, too. Thankfully that did stop by the time I was 13 or so but my pattern of self-destruction was already written by then. By then I was already made in this barely functional image. How could I do anything but hate myself, truly and deeply?

I‚Äôve never been able to hold a relationship, a friendship, or a job for very long before I blow it up. Three years at most, then I burn all the bridges. I‚Äôve been so closed off to people who tried hard to love me. I‚Äôve been hyper-sensitive to anything perceived as a threat, even when it‚Äôs no such thing. I‚Äôm always ready to lash out in defense even when the attack is only perceived. The slightest act of kindness or compassion overwhelms me; the most minute of slights strikes me like an asteroid. 

I‚Äôve tried, and I‚Äôve failed, to be better, to live somewhere other than inside my own head. I‚Äôve spent whole years of my life lying on the couch, depressed, watching my savings and the days of my life trickle away between jobs, living inside daydreams about better lives that I‚Äôll never have. I put everything away in a box, close it tight, and ignore it.

This is where I find myself now, and this is the last time.

I don‚Äôt even know how long it‚Äôs been since I quit my job at Sony. Two years, maybe more. I‚Äôve done nothing. I can‚Äôt make myself do anything. Normally I snap out of this in the nick of time, get a new job, and the pattern starts again. But not this time. Not this time. This time I couldn‚Äôt make myself care. My money is gone, I didn‚Äôt care. My apartment is a mess, I didn‚Äôt care. I knew if I didn‚Äôt come around I would be finished, and I didn‚Äôt care. I wanted it to be over. I locked myself away and ignored the world until there was nothing but a frozen burrito and two pennies left.

I‚Äôll never really be OK. Whatever it is you‚Äôre supposed to learn as a child, about how to connect with other people, how to be alive, I never learned that. I live like I‚Äôm spectating my own life from afar. I used to try. Even through my 30s, I tried so hard and it never really worked. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt have the right protocols installed. Socially dyslexic. I tried but I just hurt, pushed away, put off, alienated or ran from everyone. 

I‚Äôve only ever felt happy or at peace briefly. Anything I can lose myself in and focus on totally. Fishing. A book. An engrossing game. A project of some kind. These are my happy times. My work used to do that for me, too, and I think that saved me for a long time. But that stopped being true at some point. And with that gone I feel like I don‚Äôt have anything anymore. No amount of hobbies or pursuits or projects will fill that hole.

Whoever said time heals all wounds was wrong. It‚Äôs worse now than ever. My head spins constantly like a child with severe ADD. I can‚Äôt focus on anything for more than a few minutes. People can see it in me, now. I can tell, these past few years. Something on my face, I guess, that says I‚Äôm not OK. I think they mistake it for anger but it‚Äôs not that. I‚Äôm just broken, always trying to clamp down on my own feelings of fear and pain and confusion and frustration. I feel like an alien all the time. Every failure to communicate and connect and relate adds to it. I don‚Äôt want to be that anymore. It has to end.

I did try to get help about four years ago but Team HMO sent me on a wild goose chase. They were more interested in smoking cessation, because customers (‚Äúpatients‚Äù) who smoke cost the company (‚Äúmedical provider‚Äù) money. And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs really important, isn‚Äôt it, in this fucked up world that we‚Äôve made. If I had real doctors I think now they would have called it Borderline Personality Disorder with a side of PTSD.

And in any case, at 46 I‚Äôm too old to keep starting over like this; burning my life down and making the same one over again, ending up in the same place. I don‚Äôt want to do it anymore. I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt really want to die, but I don‚Äôt want to go on like this, either. I ignored that nagging thought on purpose - the one telling me I had to do something while I still could - so that I would have no other option when this time came. As a very young child I learned how to be numb to all the things that were wrong in my life so that I could live another day. I did it to survive. But I learned that lesson too well, I think. I never stopped doing it. And this time it‚Äôs killed me.

It‚Äôs regretful that I‚Äôve only come to this new self-understanding now, at the end. If I had figured all this out 20 years ago, I know my life would have been different. Had it come to me just two years ago, I might still be alive now. The more I think about it, the more I think I could learn how to be more comfortable with being alive, now. Now that I understand why I feel this way all the time, why I am the way I am, I‚Äôm certain I could adjust and adapt. Armed with this new knowledge, I could try. If I had time, I would try. But I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs finished.

Only anger has stopped me until now, I think. I‚Äôm angry because it feels like if I do this then the people who fucked me up and over in the first place will win. And I don‚Äôt want them to win. But today that‚Äôs not reason enough to go on.

To Jen Nolan, I know you‚Äôll never read this but I need to say it anyway, to someone. Anyone. No one tried harder than you did. No one hung in there longer than you did. I‚Äôm sorry, Boo. Wherever you are, I hope you‚Äôre happy.

I don't know what to do.I've wanted to kill myself for a long time, but I've been putting it off until I could get away from everyone I know so my death wouldn't affect them so much. To cope in the meantime, about three weeks ago I started drinking. Hard. Anywhere from 4 to 7 shots of 80 or 90 proof straight from the bottle, no meal or mixer.

And now all of a sudden, I feel ""normal."" ""better"". ""functional."" I feel like I could try to do things again and make something with my life.

But honestly, I don't want to anymore. That little piece of me that says ""I want to get better, keep going, whatever,"" feels broken, and I don't know that I want to fix it anymore. I've spent so long just wishing my life would end, not get better, just end, that feeling ""good"" all of a sudden, for a few days, feels worse than feeling bad before. At least then, I knew what I wanted.

But now I'm not even sure if I can kill myself, and that hurts even worse, and makes me upset and angry with myself. I feel guilty too...because I know I *should* try to do things and *could* do them if I tried hard enough, but that part of me doesn't want to keep going anymore.

Between the guilt, the suicidal desires, and knowing that once I stop drinking I'll probably go back to where I was....and keeping having to think ""You can do things now, you should follow your dreams"" or whatever....it's just confusing. I want to die, and now I ca'nt even do that.

155763,"my first post.Hi. 

I‚Äôve. wanted to kill myself since my 8th birthday. Let me start by saying I was a very anxious young child. I would freak out over any tiny occurrence. For example, If my parents where late getting me too a birthday party I would have a panic attack right outside, refusing to go in. By third grade, my panic attacks became a nightly problem.

I believe my depression/suicide and my anxiety aren‚Äôt as connected as my parents and doctors make it seem to be.  You see, my depression started in response to being bullied. I was constantly bullied about my size(weight, and height). I was left out and had no friends until 5th grade. 

5th grade was when all the boys and girls(i go to a coed school) started hanging out. It was only the coolest boys and girls though and back then only the fastest boys were the coolest, me being 5 2 and 200 lbs in 5th grade didn‚Äôt make me fast whatsoever. Although I wasn‚Äôt getting any attention from girls I started to make friends with the boys. Going into middle school I would say I had 4 real friends. 


Then in 6th grade, I met her. Let‚Äôs call her girl X. When she walked into the bus that first day, it was like looking at an angel. It being her first day at my school, she asked to sit next to me on the bus. That could‚Äôve been the first thing a girl said to me that wasn‚Äôt a bullying comment. Anyway, I instantly fell in love. I sat with her everyday, and I quickly learned she was perfect. We had all of the same interests.  Throughout 6th grade It wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal to be friends with a girl anymore so i started talking to more people. 

We had the same math class. I would constantly make a fool out of my self to get her to notice me and nothing worked. On a side note I think I went all of 6th grade without hanging out with anyone outside of school. Ohh by the way I forgot when but towards the end of 6th grade I asked her out. I‚Äôm sure you can guess what she said.

In the beginning of 7th grade it was more of the same. All i wanted was for this girl to notice me for more then a friend and I got nothing. Although, I started making friends. I started going out and hanging out with more people inside and outside of school. My best friends bar mitzvah was in the middle of the year. 


During the cocktail hour I remember a different friend leaning over towards me and making a joke about this kids name who crashed. Being myself who just wanted to be noticed by people, I went and introduced myself to the two kids who crashed. I was very barney Stinson i‚Äôm going to teach you how to live about the whole thing even though they were both a grade older and much taller, skinner, better looking then me. The kid with the funny name told me he wanted to hook up with girl x. girl x was my best friend at this time. Trying to act all cool i introduced the two.

The ended up making out in the middle of the dance floor, in front of everyone. my hart was crushed. I ran out of the place crying got in a cab and went home. When i got home no one was there. I decided this is it this is the night when i do it. I‚Äôm dying myself. I followed everything I had previously planed out(which i think was actually inspired by a fellow poster). I climbed inside my hamper naked holding with nothing by a knife. I kid you not through all my crying I did not hear my parents come home and my dad caught my hand/knife on its way to impail my neck. 

I stayed friends with girl X up until she left the state at the end of the year. I tried to keep my distance to protect myself It was my first love for the first girl who showed me any attention and it didn‚Äôt work out. 

So 8th grade No girl X. I spent 8th grade in the gym. Working out everyday every week every month. Now i‚Äôm here at the end of 8th grade with all the weight lost feeling just as lossed as i felt exactly 1 and 1/2 years ago.

I just wanna peel my fucking skin off just so I can experience a couple moments outside of my flesh. I had a couple people who care about me - I messaged them today and literally only 1 person replied. My supposed ""best friend"" straight up told me I was on drugs before I even said anything. I had a problem in 2015, she literally has no idea what is going on, and says I'm on dope. I take care of two other people - one with a disability. It's enough that I failed myself but I am also a useless piece of shit when it comes to them. Like it still fucking hurts - I wish they had programs for suicide assistance. I just don't want it to be sloppy, and everyone see the body and get freaked out. I'm tired of pretending I can do better. I really can't. I've had plenty of chances and I've failed every single time. I wish it was just about attention, I really do. My life is one big fucking cringe, and people want nothing to do with me, or it, and I don't blame them. I fantasize about how quickly a bullet would end all the noise - the constant battle within my head, finally. I wouldn't even realize I was dead.

270005,"A guide for being confident (mostly for guys but there‚Äôs some stuff girls can use) Hey you! Yes you, looking at this post! I used to be a quivering, unconfident welp myself, until I ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù these tips. They might not work for everyone, but it‚Äôs better than not being confident ever. (Also, sorry about the formatting I‚Äôm on mobile)

Step one: fake it til you make it.
This is gonna sound cliche, but it works I promise. If you walk with confidence (i.e not cowering to the side when someone walks by) you‚Äôre already half way there. If you *act* confident, people will see you as confident, if people see you as confident they‚Äôll treat you like you‚Äôre confident, and if they treat you like you‚Äôre confident you‚Äôll feel confident. This is the most important step and even if you don‚Äôt follow the others, I‚Äôd still recommend using this. 

Step two: your worst nightmare isn‚Äôt that powerful .
It‚Äôs true that (most) teenage guys fears teenage girls above all else. You‚Äôre brain is hard wired to pick up tiny social cues that you might not even notice. You‚Äôll naturally be subconsciously worried about what they think. The thing to remember though is that their opinions on you don‚Äôt mean jack shit. They‚Äôre just as awkward as they think you are. This is probably one of the harder steps but learn to forget they exist, their stares mean nothing to you.

Step three: don‚Äôt psych yourself out.
This is technically just an extension of the other two steps, but it warrants its own section. No matter how well you execute steps one and two, it‚Äôll all fall apart the moment you think something like ‚Äúoh fuck do I look awkward!?‚Äù If you think about stuff like that you‚Äôll start to show tiny details of worry that the brain will subconsciously pick up. The best thing to help with this is thinking the opposite. Think about how confident you are, you‚Äôre the center of your own world and that‚Äôs all that matters.

Step four: Don‚Äôt overdo it.
No matter what, don‚Äôt be dick. When I say ‚Äúconfident‚Äù I by no means am trying to say ‚Äúnarcissistic‚Äù True, you‚Äôre the center of your own world, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre the center of *the* world.

I'm so angry right now. After her ""bath"", she went to a photography class downtown, says she got a very bad headache and was dizzy during the whole thing. She's heading home right now and she just dropped the bomb 5 minutes ago. I'm fuming. I tell her to get help and she just dismisses it.

I love her so much, but right now I want to tell her to fuck off. I can't be there for her if she tries to kill herself every god damn opportunity. I want to break up, I can't take it anymore. But I fear that if I do, she'll lose all hope (that she hasn't lost already) and will actually do it full attempt no holding back. Before, I used to think our relationship was the only thing making her keep it together, but now I see that our relationship is nothing more than just a distraction for her. She wants to die. I can't do anything about it.

I want to help her. I can't.",suicide
301747,"Decided to Kill MyselfI'm a 21 year-old attending college on the West coast. I've decided to kill myself on July 4 of this year. The date's appropriate, as it represents my feelings of powerlessness and lacking independence. My whole life I've felt like I've been running away from suffering. I hated elementary school, and then middle school, so I quit. I lost both of my parents and yet graduated top of my class with full honors in high school and a full ride to a top-tier university. I had a 4.0 the first two years of college, then my mom died (whereas she previously became senile.) I lost my mind.

I've had two romantic relationships, each lasting 11 months. My first long-term girlfriend broke up with me, justifying it with, ""You're more messed up than I am."" My second girlfriend with, ""You're way more broken than me,"" and later: my personal favorite, ""You're a sociopath."" She had noticeable sociopathic tendencies ironically enough, but maybe I do as well. I went to the bar for the first time this last weekend. Intense waves of disgust flooded my being prompting my escape. Twerking, emotional explosiveness and drunkenness, a dull feeling of irritability and alienation between people, never to see each other again after a fling. Where's the meaning?

College is hell; medical school will also be hell. I take three antidepressants and abuse caffeine to keep focused on my work. I take vitamins and anti-anxiety meds, and I've dialed my diet down to a T. My work has no meaning; it helps no one. My life has no purpose; I'm a cog in the machine. They tell me to find meaning in the little things. There's no meaning in the little things. I want to have a stable family and become a husband and father. The family courts make that impossible. I sleep at least 12 hours daily and have gained so much weight from the stress. I enjoy causing other people suffering by spreading my malaise as much as possible. Oddly enough, people appreciate the honesty.

They always say it gets better, but it never has. It's gotten worse. It's gotten harder. I have a midterm in an hour. I'm going to fail. I don't care; it's a worthless evaluation. My psychiatrist wants to put me in intensive-care or maybe commit me. This post is to solidify my decision.",suicide

No one starts the conversation with me, I'll just send out random snapchats to people hoping that someone might respond and I can actually talk to them. I feel like all I do is annoy and burden everyone around me, I tell people how I feel and they never feel like listening even though I would do it for them, but it's not like anyone comes to me because they all have other friends that they like more than me anyways.

246294,"A story I want to know what you think. Let‚Äôs call this girl M. She‚Äôs a month older than me.

I‚Äôm from the UK. So in year 10 was when we first met. She and I shared a maths and science class. She was the nice, helpful person. She was the person who you borrowed pens and stuff from (pens in my case). Eventually we became acquaintances then became casual friends. She‚Äôs just nice, shy person. By the way we started talking more and more (usually started by her).

This went on until the end of year 12. In year 12 we shared 2 classes. One day in Biology she passed me a note. In the note she asked me if I could join her and other people at a library to revise. I said yes but I didn‚Äôt turn up on the day. We exchanged numbers by the way. So she texted me and asked why I couldn‚Äôt come and I said because of family. The actual reason was I thought it would be boring and I would‚Äôve been the only boy. I was already an hour late when she texted. I didn‚Äôt want to text first because it would be rude.

So she started passing notes when we had science. She asked me what my interests were and different things such as my favourite films, songs, food and the like. One day she passed me a note asking if I was free on a certain day (probably Saturday?). Then I said maybe and asked why. She wanted to invite me to go to the cinema to watch a horror film which I generally don‚Äôt like. Then I said that I‚Äôd think about it. I asked her who else is coming and she said her other friend but she‚Äôs not sure. Then the next day she asked me again and I said maybe and she said her other friend couldn‚Äôt come. Then the next day I said I couldn‚Äôt because I had something important to do. Probably I said that I don‚Äôt horror films? So we just continued to pass notes. Eventually I would just arrive and expect a note to passed or thrown to me. I have to admit sometimes it was distracting and a bit annoying. Also sometimes we would text a lot. It would get longer and more frequent. I didn‚Äôt think anything about it at first. I thought of her as a good friend.

Fast forward to the summer holidays. So we haven‚Äôt been talking for a while. I was getting bored cos there was nothing to do. So I phoned her one day and asked her if we could go out sometime and she said yes. So I had McDonald‚Äôs and she had nothing even though I asked her what she wanted cos I was being nice. So we talked and then walked around the shopping centre and then we went home. 

We‚Äôre in year 13 and we talked more (notes and normal conversations) and people started noticing even the teachers. We sat next to each other in Biology but there was a table in between us and she sat next to her (best) friend. In chemistry depending on which room we had the lesson I sometimes sat with M and her friend and sometimes I sat with my friends. One day in chemistry the three of us were sat in the same table. The situation was such that we talked both in notes and normally, and that her friend was being left out. So her friend joined another table (to ask for help or stop being left out). So the (female) teacher saw what was going on so I took and hid all of the notes. She asked for notes and I declined. So the teacher and I were talking and she was just there. My teacher was smiling in a way that indicated that she knew what was going on and I was uncomfortable and giggly. But we continued anyway.

One day she asked me if I wanted to go to the cinema to see a horror film. I said yes because I wanted to watch it. It was just the 2 of us. We bought food and offered each other what we bought. We were talking whilst were watching and she‚Äôs talking about the actors in the film. We were also talking about what was funny about the film. 

One day we had 2 split biology lessons. At the end of the first she was in a hurry to go out with her friend. I had a feeling she and her friend were up to something. So I followed them out and was told it was something private. To give some context M‚Äôs friend and I are in the same form and one day she asked me if I liked someone and I said no. Also a funny thing happened in that same lesson. A person noticed the amount of notes we were passing and he said ‚Äúdo you two like each other?‚Äù. We were uncomfortable. That same person said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre turning red. It‚Äôs true. Isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù. 

The next lesson by the end she passed me a note saying she had to take something off her chest. She asked me not to tell anyone.  She said she liked me. I was shocked and didn‚Äôt know what to feel. She asked me if I wanted to stay friends with her. I said yes. I know now what she meant by that. The next lesson on a different day it was awkward and by the end she said sorry and asked if we were still friends. I said yes.

So it went back to normal. One day after school we went to Burger King. I put my favourite perfume on (which I usually do). After I got off the bus to get home she texted me ‚ÄúYou smelled nice today‚Äù. This was not weird at all just to clarify. 

So this went on. Just before Christmas I asked her if she wanted to go to a shopping centre after school and she said yes and that she‚Äôd treat me to something. The next thing was weird. So I expected her to come to me cos our last lesson was Biology. So as I walked to bus stop I saw that she walking ahead of me. So she disappeared and I texted to ask her where she was she said at the bus stop. I said that I was near to the same bus stop as well. So I ran to the same bus stop and we got on the same bus and not sat near each other. 

We arrived at the shopping centre. So I walked ahead of her and saw that she wasn‚Äôt following. So I just went on my own. While I was buying something I received a text asking me where I was which I told her.  I asked her the same thing and told me where she was. So I went there and saw she wasn‚Äôt there and so I went home. 

The next couple of days I felt that she was kind of ignoring me. So I just ignored her and had fun with my friend who sat next to me to make her feel left out. After a couple of days I told her friend the situation. She asked me if had done anything wrong and I said no. Funnily enough whilst me and my other friend were having fun during lesson she passed me a note essentially catching up. I told her ‚Äúwhere have you been?‚Äù.  We just texted later and she explained that she was upset about what happened at the shopping centre and I apologised. 

We usually play 21 dares while we text each other which usually lasted hours till 12:30 am. It‚Äôs like truth or dare but the only option is truth. Eventually it led to the point where she had to admit who her crush was but she insisted I told her who mine was as well. It was  so awkward. She usually asked me after what to do after and I said I don‚Äôt know. 

Also another time we did the same thing but on paper during class but we exchanged notes at the end of the lesson and disappear thereafter.

This happened again during lockdown but this time I knew but I played dumb when she asked me to guess. She described him as funny, intelligent and that they were in the same biology and chemistry lesson. 

I realised that this couldn‚Äôt go on forever cos we‚Äôre going on our separate ways for uni. Gladly we are not the same as before. 

Also I was surprised that when I told my friend about everything he told me that he knew that there was something going on.

Today in therapy (DBT) we were focused on self-invalidation's, a large one for me is the thought that I will never be seen/ treated as a normal woman. During therapy another member of the group referred to me as ""he"" (causing emotional heightening) after already being emotional from the subject matter itself. Later on, the person who I rely on to get me to therapy and medical appointments (a married older man) suggested that I start cancelling some of my appointments so he won't have to drive me so much since he has ""lost hope in our relationship's growth"" (He has made sexual advances that were denied).

100920,"Cheated OnHi there, a little background information on me: My name is Alex, I turned 24 last month and I broke things off with my ex (23) last weekend. We've dated for two years and have been on and off for the longest time. She has borderline personality disorder and I have my own issues with abandonment growing up. When we first met, we hooked up rather quickly and it was a huge red flag for both my mother and I, but being as I had never had a girlfriend before, I ignored them and pursued a relationship with her. Throughout the course of our relationship, she kept a lot of male attention and claimed they were only friends when in reality she was either cheating or making money as an escort online. She'd cheat, I'd find out, we'd break up, we'd miss each other, we'd get back together, and on and on... It eventually started to take a toll on me and I attempted to take my life because I felt like I wasn't worth anything anymore. All the abandonment issues I had been running from in my childhood started to surface and I couldn't handle the overwhelming feeling that I wasn't good enough for anyone to love. Long story short I ended up 5150'd and on release I found my phone flooded with sobbing messages of regret from my ex. It's so hard hearing the voice of someone you love saying how much they miss you and love you and regret everything they've done and apologize like they've never done before, but looking back I know I fell in love with someone who doesn't exist all the time. We were together for a few months before she started doing the same thing again and I ended things off. I spent a while alone trying to date around and ended up meeting someone else who on paper seemed like the ideal girlfriend: no mental problems, had a job, had a car, had her own place--everything my girlfriend lacked. The only problem was that I wasn't physically attracted to her. I broke things off with her after two months because I realized it wasn't fair to waste her time if I wasn't falling in love like I had with my ex. A month later, my mother and stepdad were planning a thanksgiving dinner at the local country clubhouse where my ex worked (I had assumed due to her borderline personality disorder and work history that she wouldn't have held down this job) and offered to buy me a seat so I agreed. She ended up still working there and the entire time she was really pleasant and nice to my parents while I tried being an asshole and just ignored her attempts to strike a conversation. At the end of the dinner when we were about to leave, she asked my parents for a hug and they agreed. The whole time, they were falling for her shit and I really hated it so I just walked off to the car alone. When I got home I messaged her back telling her to eff off should we ever run into her again and that I didn't appreciate the little show she put on. She defended her self and said that during our break up (it had been 8 months or so since we last talked) that she had done some growing up, she had kept her job, and had really been ashamed of everything. We talked for a long time and we eventually got back together. We were together since Nov and it ended last weekend when I caught her talking to other guys who openly flirted with her despite her mentioning me. (I don't know to what extent this flirting went to because she deleted the history prior to the day we broke up, but the day we did, they had flirted and he seemed to have been giving good morning texts so...) Either way, right now I feel a bit hopeless. I feel worthless and lost right now. I don't know where I'm going or what my purpose is, but I can't help but feel like I'm at fault. Was the sex bad? Was I not giving enough attention? Am I ugly? Poor? Short? What's so wrong with me to deserve this? I don't know what to do, I just want to run away from this pit of despair in my gut. I just want to go home and have a beer and cry all this crap out because I have too much to live for. I can't go back to wanting to end myself but at the same time I want to move forward, I just need someone to talk to as I don't have friends. ",suicide

343313,"Need help with a friend (repost from r/depression)My boyfriend has had depression for about 2 years or longer now. He has ideation about ending it all, often, and has for a very long time. He seems to just be sinking, and getting closer to hurting himself.

I am not in his presence in real life. I cannot detoxify his home, I am not physically there, I can't possibly be online all the time, he's alone somtimes, like when I'm at school, I cannot buy him anything like medication (we're both 16), and I cannot directly help to get him therapy or any professional help.

What do I do? I am so desperate to help him get better. I feel like he could end it all any day now, I need to get him help, this isn't okay. I am deeply afraid. I'm so concerned, I care about him so much, and I really really need some suggestions. There must be something I can do. Even just suggestions on how to talk with him would be nice. In the past, for a long time, I was preachy, assertive, and did all the wrong things. I need anything you guys can give me, Anything.

Edit: Details about the depression. He has a major inferiority complex. if he's not THE best, he'll often break down. Help with that? He's also got divorced parents, largely, I believe, which spurred the depression, and his dad is depressed and alone, and that makes things just 100x times worse. How do I help with this?

Double Edit: If he can tell his parents about his moods, he may be able to get help and a therapist/meds. But he won't. How do I convince him to tell his mom or dad so he gets a therapist?",suicide

207882,"Please. Help, I've been submitting this for the last week, no responses...just religious and spammers.Hey All,

It's really hard to find an individual, or even a medical professional who is more than just a recent grad who dials 911 at anyone expressing anything slightly less than farting rainbows and kittens.  


I've gone though 3 psychiatrists and undergone a large number of invasive tests...and the results are in. I'm not chemically depressed...I'm officially logically depressed. I've also been with 5 different therapists over the last 5 years who all...sadly tossed up their hands not knowing where to go. (The last one suggested I take out personal ads in the paper to try and make friends :/ )


That is, I've got an odd I.Q. and means of reasoning. (It has served me wonders in the engineering world and music!) Problem is, ever since middle school 'distraction' has been the goal of avoiding depression. 


And after quitting college, going to a trade school, becoming a professor of the class I took, then going onto working the floor in a global steel renewable energy company, to becoming their senior welding engineer of that same company all in less than 2 years, only to quit when I was being asked to partake in fraudulent activities...I'm back in middle school. 


Distraction is the game.


I'm curious if there are any therapists or psychologists who can rationally work through things instead of the usual 'I'm here to help you solve the issue.'....I'm looking for those few pragmatic individuals who don't find answers in just locking someone up. (I promise, I volunteered to be in 'da looney bin' for several months, and all that was really said was, 'His participation in group discussion made the doctors uncomfortable because his reasonings, while popularly taboo, weren't unreasonable. I.E. The question of 'Is suicide ever an option?' 'Always...if you're being ran over by a steamroller...toes first, relief if sooner sought that proving hope for unaltered resolution exists.') That and they couldn't understand how a competent pianist would volunteer to participate.


Anyways, kinda stuck in a rut. No, I'm not foolish enough to take my own life. Sheesh, I know there's still 'hope' as I'm still trying. Issue is, I keep adding in different scenarios...and the results are still...bubkis. (And it's not as simple as 'well we all die anyways so what's the point') I promise it's much more well constructed than that.


So, if you or anyone else know of someone or somewhere that has a proactive and NON-KNEE JERK reaction to people wanting to discuss depression without limitation (including the planning of self termination), please let me know.


Suicide Hotlines are meant for those that are scared and terrified and need help. That's stellar for them, and I always wish them well. Same with all the 'dial up' and 'here to comfort' phone services.

Thank you for your help!

Edit: Yes, physical exercise is a great idea! I've only owned a motor vehicle for 3 years now, and prior I walked, biked, and hiked everywhere. Even did a marathon a year ago! But I've been sitting stagnant for the last half a year as futility sets in. Even with all the jogging training, and similar. It was just me...at the 'race', just me at the finish line...and just my brain on the long drive home. 

EDIT: On of the maddening ideas is doing what many were asked to in primary school, ""Draw a picture of who you want to be in the future."" Instead, paint how you die. And I envision, if I am still sitting here in 10 years with no change, how much I'd loath myself for not taking action today. I'm a proactive individual and seeing problems down the road usually inspired action today. As you can imagine that proactive plan isn't the best when it comes to self termination. Problem is, I see myself as alone, in the same chair I've been sitting for years. It doesn't matter the job or similar, I regret the time wasted...but I know it wasn't, it was spent agonizing over change...change that I can't create, change that is dependent on the actions of others. And being alone...as I have been is not a point I want to meet.

That's how it goes day to day, night to night:

""Where do I want to be?""
""With others.""
""Am I there?""
""No.""
""Did we try something different today?""
""Yes, we stopped in the library and tried to talk to people...how rude ha.""
""Will it change if the same thing is tried?""
""No, that's insanity.""

Imagine doing this every single day...for over a decade. Maddening.

So...question to you, If you knew that on the day you died, nothing had changed from today aside from bills, politics, the weather, and your physical age/health, what made the passage of time noticeable?

I was 16, scrubbing toilets at college, was quite content with that. And while walking to work at 4a.m. one morning, I had a bit of euphoria. I liked where I lived, I enjoyed the people I saw while working, I liked being able to walk through the woods, and row on the shores of Lake Superior...and I'd be content to live this day again with no change. That in that moment, i could see myself 40 year later in the same routine, and it was acceptable.

In that moment, I found peace and thought, 'If I died, today or 40 years from now doing this, it would be the same as dying now.' 

I should have taken than and done myself in then...it's been down hill ever since! ha.


**EDIT:** For the first time in my life, I had a dream where I found myself, after having failed miserable in front of others to cook something properly, that I found myself banding my fists on the wooden kitchen flood,dropped to my knees SHOUTING!!!! ""I JUST WANT TO DIE! I JUST WANT TO DIE!"" What a way to wake up. Thank you subconscious for the non-subtle imagery.

**""Io fei gibetto a me de le mie case.""** In middle school, after making a belt in a leather working class (part of the boyscout camp I taught at), I stamped this into the back of it.

Cheated on the 1st, got 2 boys with her (9 and 11 - crazy names, might change them next year...) . Current wife is REALLY struggling with how she sees their behaviour (on the occasional times she's around them - due to her work, and when we have them here) they're generally not naughty kids, they're just... Kids... And sometimes they fuck up. Don't we all. They obviously try and lie to stay out of trouble when they do fuck up, but my wife hates lying.

So, tonight I was having a stern word with the eldest after he lied about peeing on the toilet seat. He was stood there, started to wobble and sway, then literally went rigid and started to fall. Luckily I caught him. After I got him safely onto the floor he was hyperventilating. Was very scared and confused as to what happened. Wife is saying he's being a drama queen and putting it on and I fell for it. I think he got himself so wound up and anxious and had some kind of blackout. Wife calls bullshit, and now we're not talking. The passion (from her side) left a long time ago, and now she despises my kids' behaviour. And me.

He's fine now, back at his mom's.

&amp;#x200B;

I get it, no one chooses to be here and that life is so rare that we should make the most of it because (to our knowledge) we only get one chance at life. I really get it. But if we can't choose our birth I feel that we should at least choose the time and date for our death.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm completely hopeless, lonely, and tired. Maybe I haven't tried everything to feel even an ounce of happiness, but I'm so tired of this immense emotional pain I feel constantly. Seriously, I wish there was a way I could convey to someone how it feels; except that I wouldn't wish this pain on even my worst enemy.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no emotional support in my life. Didn't grow up with a dad. Practically grew up without a mom. The rest of my relatives lived across the ocean. At 14, I got the worse advice I've ever heard: ""Be your own parent"". I was so desperate for some sort of feeling of family that I followed it anyway -- it screwed me up and only drove a bigger rift between my mom and dad. It shaped who I am today. And I don't like who I am. Just thinking about who I am right now disgusts the flying fuck out of me. You don't understand.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried changing it. I saw a reddit comment once about how people should try to have a sense of being genuine, kind and having integrity; and I wanted to follow that. That was the type of person I really respected and wanted to follow. I've been trying. Every single day for almost 6 months now. I try to be what I want to see in the world. 

&amp;#x200B;

And yet I still have no substantial friends. No ""family"". No one to fall back on. Two of the people that actually gave a shit about me got pushed away because of my depression. Its too much.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried most things at this point. Therapy, sleeping better, eating better, just in general taking better care of myself. I've listened to podcasts and ted talks on mental health. I've read books on ""emotional bandaging"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Like I put in a real, solid effort.

&amp;#x200B;

But for a while now I've just felt like if I didn't exist, it would be so much better. It would help my mom, so that she wouldn't have to pay for my college anymore (which she lords over me every single day btw like i get it you could take away the money at anytime but fyi that doesnt help me feel good like why did you even offer to pay in the first place if this is what you were planning to do). She told me today that she could pay off her mortgage, give it to someone else because she **knows** they'll use it better, or use it to travel. Gee thanks I already feel like a disgusting piece of shit, thanks for reaffirming that I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then somehow it became about how I was so disrespectful to her in high school and I tried explaining why (5 years of emotional abuse made me lose respect for her as a parent causing me not to communicate with her at all. we were like roommates that didn't talk during that time.) Like yeah I get it,you didn't have a son, I'm sorry. But I didn't have a mom. You gave me all the material affection like food, clothes and a roof. And yeah my situation could be so much worse. But I would trade for a worse circumstance for a more loving mother. Any time I was emotionally hurt she would just give me advice or cut me off because she had no patience to hear what I had to say.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried explaining to her how it was for me. I know how it was for her. But I don't think she understands or even wants to understand how it was like for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no one to send this to. I wish I did. I wish I had someone I could send this to and they would come pick me up and talk to me. I wish we could drive to the mountains where the road is windy and listen to some chill lo-fi trap or some other millennial shit. I want a friend who cares. I think that would give me at least an ounce of hope to live.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to feel that comfort. But I don't have anyone like that. For a long while now. It sucks feeling alone, feeling these feelings, and having no one to share it with. I get it, it's a lot of emotional baggage -- and I have a lot. But it would really help.

For the past 2 years, I have not *actually* talked with anyone. About 6 months ago, I started talking with this one dude in my programming class, and we kept on talking on a daily basis.

Tonight (on Twitter), I made a comment about disliking Big Brother, his girlfriend, and his best friend tell me to shut up. I reply that it is my opinion and that I'm not going to shut up. They start telling me to shut the fuck up, fuck off, and start attacking me and saying how they don't care about my opinion and that I should get a life, etc. Nothing I'm not used to.

I begin to get frustrated, call her a bitch, call him a douche (after he called me a douche). They start dragging my friend into it, saying that he should be defending his girlfriend and his best friend, not even caring about his opinion on the subject. About 20 minutes of arguing later, his best friend blocked me on Twitter, but his girlfriend kept at it.

At this point I was so pissed that I couldn't understand any of what I was posting, and I'm just saying words. I make a death threat to his girlfriend saying that I would rip her head off if she didn't fuck off, she dares me, but by that time I immediately regret saying anything of the nature. I admit that it was an empty threat, I apologized, and she keeps this shit going.

I'm at my computer just exhausted, I did not want any more arguing, and so I just keep relying for her to shut up and fuck off. She keeps telling me to shut up and fuck off, and I attempt to reason with her that I did not initiate the confrontation and therefore do not have the obligation to end it. Just being stubborn as fuck.

A few hours after the argument, I talk with my friend on facebook, and at 3:14 am, he tells me we need to talk telling me I can't be saying that shit to his girlfriend, I agree, and tell him I wasn't thinking rationally, and that I feel extremely guilty about it. He tells me it pisses him off and he tells me he loves her and that she is amazing (as though it's objective). I agree with him. He explains I insulted every one of his friends and that when he doesn't speak up about it, they get pissed at him. I agree with him, almost arguing with him, but I decide otherwise.

Then he tells me

231438,"Feeling helpless this summer, again.When I quit my retail job for a better paying job in a small business clinic, I thought my life was getting better.

Until I started working at the clinic and had a manager that gave me shit all the time to the point where it made my depression and anxiety worse. She would essentially tell me that I was useless and worthless and it didn't take too long for me to feel that way. I ended up quitting after 2 miserable weeks, and without finding another job first. 

Now I'm unemployed and without income. As a college student - a nursing student. My cash supply is dwindling because of food and gas expenses, and I'm lying to my parents about my unemployment because I can't bare the shame of telling them that their daughter is a quitter.

I must have applied to more than a dozen jobs in retail since then. I'm desperate, and willing to take any job. Even one that would pay less than I was getting before - which was just $11 an hour. But I haven't heard back from anyone. And this just makes me feel even more worthless than ever.

To add insult to injury, I'm not doing so hot in the one summer class that I'm taking thanks to a bad start in the beginning of the semester when my depression was so bad I had no motivation to do anything. I might have to retake the class - which is more money I don't have.

All of my financial issues are overwhelming me and I feel way too young to take all this responsibility. It's a constant burden and a headache and I just want to run away from it all somehow or some way... Suicide keeps coming back to my mind. Depression and anxiety are battles I've been fighting since I was fourteen. I'm approaching 19 this August, and I don't feel any older or wiser or more capable of fighting this battle.

I feel ashamed for complaining about this, when there are others that are going through so much worse. And I wish I was strong enough to handle my own measly problems. But I can't. And I feel even more pathetic and worthless as a result.

It's neverending.

284681,"The downward spiral continues.Let's try this again.

I wrote up a... 'thing' ~1 year ago. [Here is the link to it](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hu8tp/this_feels_pointless_and_i_see_no_light_at_the/).

Surprisingly little has changed since then from a mental standpoint. From the events of my life, there have been a few changes. I am partially pursuing music, which is probably what I need to be doing with my life. No, not writing songs, but singing. I went on various music tours and had people tell me, ""Hey, if you studied this stuff and had a foundation in music theory, you could definitely have a career as a singer.""

That may be one of those possibilities way down the road if I survive, but who knows if I'll last that long. This would probably be a good time to read the last thread I wrote; click the link.


I now work 6 days a week for jobs that pay $10/hour. I am rapidly approaching 30. I live on a building on my parents' property (non mom&amp;dad's house thank fuck), my car is still in need of several thousand dollars worth of repairs, so I ride a motorcyle to work. No issues there, really; I like the gas savings. I continue to get fatter and fatter, and drink vodka several nights a week to keep out out of my own head. This is probably some sort of defense mechanism on my subconscious level, because vodka makes me happier and stupid. I'd have probably offed myself long ago without it. 

I have been blessed/cursed with a high IQ. Mentioning this causes resentment most of the time, because people hate to admit the possibility that others are smarter than them. I could have 3/4 my intelligence quotient and still be on the right side of the IQ bell curve. At this point I assume I would rather be happy than smart. Drinking dumbs me down, but if I drink too much I see through my own facade and know this enjoyment is only temporary. Even social drinking is a delicate borderline-scientific experience.

I just want to die. There are a few things that I would like to live to see through, but most aren't worth the effort. I am very lonely. I do not talk to anyone about what I feel. Never. Opening up to another human means letting down my mental defenses, and that means there is a possibility that human can manipulate and/or control my way of thinking. I WILL NOT BE CONTROLLED. I realized this obstinance is stupid and serves no purpose, but that is my mentality. I would gladly die before submitting to another's will. I don't think I have a strong survival instinct.

Obviously, there is some part of me clinging to life. That part of me is what you're reading right now. The rest has long since checked out, and is just waiting for me to make a choice to either end it all or take steps to try and fix my trainwreck of an existence. Not even sure how I'd do the latter at this point. I don't even fucking know why I'm writing this out, much less submitting it. It's not like I welcome the suggestions with open arms; my response is completely guarded and hesitant.

Maybe this is just selfish of me, but please ... try and win me over with an argument of logic. *Why go on?*. Don't use the shitty argument of ""oh it's so selfish to kill yourself."" That's a stupid argument and I could rant about that for a while about how the accusor is, in fact, the selfish one demanding the suicidal person remain in tormential existence for their own comfort. I talked with a friend over AIM a while back who was dealing with a friend who committed suicide. This person on AIM was angry, and insinuated that their dead friend was, 'a coward' and/or, 'took the coward's way out'. You know what? Fuck if I even care if you think it's the 'coward's way out'. Fuck you for demanding that I stay alive just so you feel better about yourself.

The funny part is... she would show more interest or love for me **if I was the type that would rob her**. I've never seen a single or lonely gang member.

I am 17 and have always had my life planned for me, from school to sports clubs people and friends just came naturally. However, since I have moved to sixth form in 2019, loneliness has hit me like a ton of bricks. My boyfriend broke up with me in August which was really tough because he was my best friend and basically the only person I had. He continued to act like we were in a relationship in some ways which only made the depression worse as he wanted to speak to more girls and party more. It really took a huge impact on my self esteem because he had said to me that he had lost attraction and wanted me to lose weight for him to fall in love with me again. We recently decided we won‚Äôt try again which has led to me being extremely depressed. Not only do I have horrific self esteem but now I am completely alone and so sad about what my life has become. I am so jealous of everyone one around me who has friends and people to live them, I just feel alone and hopeless.

I suppose I can't talk to anybody in real life about this because I can't let them know what I plan to do. I haven't spoken to my friends or family in weeks.

I plan to end my life this weekend. I'm looking forward to it, if anything. For half a decade now I have been miserable and all I would like is for it to stop, to have no more worries, and I am certain the only way to achieve this is to end my life. I'm unemployed and terrified of starting work. I've lost all motivation and hope. I have no desire for relationships or even sex anymore. My appearance has suffered as a result. I have nothing going for me.

The part that troubles me to no end is the pain I know my friends and family will feel. I've been contemplating ways to make it easier on them. Simply disappearing won't help as they'll always wonder what happened to me and won't find closure. I consider buying them gifts with the last of my money, something for them to help remember me when I'm gone, but it seems selfish to force a constant reminder on to them. Money or objects don't help grief - I know this first hand.

My mum passed away very suddenly a few years ago when I was 17. I was the one who found her. It was the most severe pain I have ever felt. My grandparents were equally devastated, they rarely talk about it and they still cry sometimes when reminded, having to leave the room to gain composure.

Knowing how it feels to lose someone close to you and the thought of forcing my grandparents to endure that pain a second time... it makes me want to cry. Myself and my older sibling have been their solace since it happened - it comforts them to make sure we're okay. They do a lot for me.

I have a group of friends who care deeply for me. Some of them have been in my life for ten years. I have been unhappy for so long without ""getting better"" that I don't even mention it anymore, I feel like it's a drain on them, like I'm a broken record. They have their own issues. Still, I know that any one of them would rush to comfort me if I asked for it. They are good friends.

Despite all this, all I have thought about for weeks is suicide. It's the first thing on my mind in the morning and the last thing at night. I've researched online extensively about the best methods, the statistics, the survivor stories, etc. I've planned it all out. I try to tell myself that I won't be here once my loved ones find out and that I won't have to witness their pain. Still, I feel tremendous guilt.

69606,"I can finally be free. Death is my choice.All I ever wanted was freedom. Death isn't sad or macabre, and especially not taking my own life. It's a choice. It's a decision to leave in my own way, on my terms.

I have been suicidal for many years. I was eight when I first seriously contemplated it - it brought a strange sense of comfort.

Through the years, I made multiple attempts, but they were truthfully half-assed, impulsive and badly researched.

The truth is, I have no chance of ever leading a ""normal"" life. I have no money or own home, no family, a very abusive history, a plethora of mental illnesses, a physical disability, arthritis and gradually worsening physical conditions (which are exacerbated by my disability). 

I'm 26: This isn't going to go away. It's going to get worse and worse. I would rather die with dignity now, than be immobile by the time I'm 50.

The person who kept me alive was my father. He assured me that if I were to commit suicide, he would follow. So I felt I couldn't possibly go through with it. Despite our turbulent relationship, I did not want to be the cause of his death.

After his traumatic death in July, I dealt with the aftermath and plodded through. I now realise that with the person keeping me tied to life being gone, I can go through with this.

But I'll do it **properly** this time.

There will be no ""mess"". I have chosen a method that will at least look peaceful. I simply need to do more research to be absolutely certain, and discreetly acquire the materials. I will get an enema beforehand and wear an adult diaper for good measure, too. It's not fair to expect anyone to clean up after me.
I will do my hair and makeup. I will wear my best outfit and jewellery. I will be as presentable as possible. I will cover myself prior to performing the method, and attach a note - in case someone finds me before emergency services do - to call emergency services as soon as possible, and to not look at me.
I will compose a thank you note for the emergency services and coroner. They do a hard job and those who dealt with my dad handled everything so professionally.

I will ensure my Will has been written and witnessed, and will write detailed letters to those who mattered, in particular my partner.

I will sell all belongings or donate to charity so that any personal items that need to be dealt with are at an absolute minimum.

I will sort out all paperwork and close as many accounts as possible.

I have chosen my funeral director and cremation package.

I'm doing this, but I'm doing it properly. In the right way, with careful consideration for those involved and measures in place to minimise hassle and trauma.

I'm lonely anyway. The person who will be most effected is my partner. I'll do all I can to ensure he knows there is nothing he could have possibly done and leave the estate to him so that he has extra funding to help him out.

My original deadline was October 7th, but the Will won't be finalized until the end of the month. So I figured, I could do this after my birthday in November. This will give me plenty of time to plan this extensively and ensure there is nothing forgotten.

Then I can spend one more cherished day with the person who matters most to me.


At last, I will be free.",suicide

302566,"I wish I landed head first when I jumped off the bridgeTwo years ago I jumped, broke my ankles and fractured a leg, messed up my spine. Some fucking person just had to ""save"" me and call an ambulance. After being rehabilitated and able to be in a wheelchair I was locked in a psychiatric ward. They tied me down to a bed like I was some kind of animal.

After I got out, I can no longer be prescribed anti depressants (I was on them when I attempted suicide), and I can no longer tell my therapist I want to commit suicide in fear of being sent to the psychiatric ward.

Every single day I wish I would have just jumped head first. I'm in special education at school, I haven't made a friend in 10 years since I've moved to America when I was 8. I have selective mutism which is packaged with crippling social anxiety. I have diabetes. I have dyslexia. I have ADHD. And don't forget severe depression. I fail most classes which are 3 years behind my age level. My parents shipped me to America when I was 8. Then I was adopted by religious psycho fucks. Then I was molested by a priest a few months after being in America. He told me if I told anyone I would go to hell, dumbass me believed that for a few years until it was too late. People already know I am mental nobody will believe me. Now my parents are kicking me out of the house in a year and making me homeless because I don't believe in their religion (or rather, cult). Gee, thanks God (is what I'd say if he existed).

I am in love with my step brother, he's 3 years younger than me (15,18) and everyone thinks I'm a child molester (even though that would be legal in Canada). He makes me happier than anything in the world, but it's considered incest, THAT'S FUCKING DISGUSTING. So I'm not going to be able to be with him romantically. But on the other hand, becoming transgender is TOTALLY normal and acceptable.

These flamers on the LGBT train claim ""love is love"" but when it's me and my brother, ""that's disgusting"".

And there was a pool, about a five minute walk from the treehouse. So on day 2 of the 7 day trip, I decide to go down to the pool. I grab my towel, sandals, and sunscreen, then continue to walk down the trail. My siblings and cousin were already at the pool, and I decide to explore (the pool was in a ravine) and my sister says ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it, you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs out there, you might get hurt!‚Äù I look at her and say ‚ÄúSince when do you care about me?‚Äù And I jump down into the ravine. I look around, nothing interesting. I look at my feet, pretty nice pile of leaves next to my left foot. But that pile of leaves started *moving* and *hissing*, at this point I basically shat my soul out through my ears. I was paralyzed of fear. The snake looked me in the eye, I was thinking ‚Äú*if I move, I‚Äôll get bit, if I don‚Äôt move, I‚Äôll get bit*‚Äù and I was panicking on the inside. My cousin looks over and says ‚ÄúHoly hell thats a snake! Help him out!‚Äù As he proceeds to grab a stick and slap the snake with it, directing the snakes vision towards him, I start running to the deck, and the snake bites at my heel, missing my shoe my centimeters. My cousin keeps poking it to distract it, the snake bites the stick and hold on, my cousin runs with the stick and sets it down about 40 feet away from where we were. My brother grabbed my cousins phone and took a picture of the snake, and after we got up to the tree house, we told our parents what happened. My mom started freaking out and my uncle was impressed and mad at my cousins actions. My uncle wanted to ground my cousin for poking the snake with a stick, but decided not to because he saved my life. My mom just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre okay‚Äù and that‚Äôs it.

‚ÄúHow the fuck do yuo have 700 followrrrs‚Äù

Spelled exactly like that. I had mentioned during the stream that I had a lot of followers on Reddit. 
I responded. I quickly realized that he was your average Redditor: a 14 yr old boy. 

We talked for a while, then discovered that we live in the same state. Turns out we live about 45 minutes from each other.
He wanted to talk some more, so we switched over to Instagram for a bit, so that I could see his face and make sure that he‚Äôs not a 60 yr old man. 

To save time for anyone reading this, long story short we ended up FaceTiming every night for almost 2 weeks. He introduced me to a few of his friends, who I now consider my friends. He convinced me to buy Minecraft (I only bedrock up until then) and added me to a realm with his friends, along with a discord server with all of them. 
I played daily, and still do, talking with people on the server as we play.

Just know that I will always be watching over you and cheering for you. Thank you for dedicating 18 years of your life to being the best brother your sister could ever ask for. I love you and I‚Äôm sorry. 

To A, my best friend for the last four years: we‚Äôve grown apart with time but I‚Äôll never forget all the horseback riding we did together in high school at your neighbor‚Äôs house. Those horses and your friendship gave me everything to look forward to as a teenager and I‚Äôll always cherish those memories. Thanks for being my friend through everything. I‚Äôll always love and remember you. 

To J, I know I promised you I wasn‚Äôt suicidal anymore after I confessed to planning my suicide last month but I wasn‚Äôt being entirely truthful. I‚Äôm still hurting so badly and I‚Äôm so tired. Just know that I always wanted to be there for you as best as I could and your problems were always important to me. I also want you to know that I‚Äôm so glad you survived your accident back in October. I hope someday you find peace and solace and know that there is a whole world of people who love you. 

To D, my ex. God I love you more than words can describe. You were everything to me. You are so wonderful, please never forget that. I‚Äôm sorry things ended the way they did. I‚Äôm sorry I was so terrible to you after. I never hated you and I‚Äôm not angry, I‚Äôm just so hurt. But I love you more than anything in the world and I always will. Please never forget that. Thank you for the time you gave me. I‚Äôm resting easy now. I love you and I‚Äôm sorry. Goodbye my darling. 

To my coworkers, thank you for always trying to make me laugh and smile on a bad day. Your kindness means more than words can say, and you have been such a wonderful work family to me. I love you all and I‚Äôm so glad I got to know you guys. 

To my therapist, I‚Äôm sorry I was so beyond help. I really did want it, but I‚Äôm so tired of fighting. Some people are meant for this world. I am not one of those people. Thanks for doing everything you could. You gave me a lot of relief from my pain whenever we talked. You‚Äôre a wonderful therapist and I‚Äôm sorry for letting you down. 


This is the end. Goodbye everyone. I‚Äôm so sorry.",suicide

He has physically attacked me for small things, and would easily kill me for something as silly as being different.

278369,"Please help for my parents sake... (big scary wall of text)Hey. I'm a guy, turning 20 next week, and I want to die. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 13, and they keep getting worse and worse. I've never been happy, and I dont think I ever will be. Here's my life in a nutshell:

&gt; I was born in western new york, just a few miles from the Canadian boarder. When I was 3, my sister was born, and when I was five, just about to start kindergarten, we moved cross-country to Denver Colorado, leaving all my friends and family behind. My parents divorced when I was 6, and I spent the next few years keeping secrets and lying on their behalf and listening to them badmouth each other. When I was 8, my mom got re-married to my least favorite person in the world, my stepdad. A year later they had my half sister. A year after that, we moved back to new york. (my dad too)

&gt; I didnt have many friends growing up. Kids picked on me and bullied me relentlessly. Most of middle and high school was just me trying to get through the day. I dont have any fond memories of my time at either school.

&gt; After high school, I spent a semester at culinary school. I hated it so very much. I didnt have any friends there either, and had zero skill. I couldnt take head chefs throwing my food around calling it garbage. I dropped out.

&gt; After that, I went back home and started attending a local community college, which is where I am now.


&gt; My mom knows how much I wanted the college experience, and how much I hate my stepdad. She's been paying for me to have an apartment right across the street. She pays for everything, so that I can focus on school. The thing is, I dont. I get crap grades. I hardly ever go to class because it all seems... pointless. Last semester, I totally gave up at the end because I honestly thought I'd be dead by Christmas break. After explaining to my mom, she said she understood because of the depression. She told me that when she was in college, she felt depressed too, and that she used to cut herself. She would keep paying for my apartment, but I had to do better next semester.

&gt; Which brings us to now. I started out this semester alright, doing well in all my classes. But then, I fell off the wagon. I'm still in the pit I was in last semester. I'm doing poorly in all my classes, and was administratively dropped from one of them.

Long story short, I think I'm shit. I've spent my entire life alone, and feel like a leech on everyone who does nothing but take. There's never been a time where I've truly been happy. I have no goals, no dreams, no ambition, no skills. Nothing. The only time I've ever been kissed was by some random drunk girl at a new years party. I just feel like... I dont know, I have nothing to look forward to. The world would be a better place without me, or at the very least, it wouldnt make a difference.

Honestly, the only thing stopping me is what my parents would think. I dont want to put my parents through it. They've both worked so hard and sacrificed so much for me and my sisters. But I have a feeling that any day now I'm going to hit a particularly low point and in that moment, I wont be worried about it. If it says anything, I decided that if I do do it, it's going to be by pill overdose, so they dont have to discover a mutilated body. Sorry this was so poorly written, I'm just spewing everything on my mind right now...",suicide

40727,"was feeling really happy, now i feel depressed again.where to start, i feel pathetic, ill start here. A few years ago i hated my life, was never happy, had suicidal thoughts, etc. Then i met my exbestfriend, she made me smile, we related, i admit i had feelings developed for her, but whatever i rather keep the friendship. So the years went by, i helped her through ALLOT of tough times. there was a time 4 months ago i told her how i felt we sopped talking, but SHE wanted to stay friends (I was fine whre things were left)

Anyways now were in college (same college) last 2 months we hung and talked everyday. So one day i was going to go to her class, i slept in a little, text her saying im coming, then she spammed my phone with the text ""k"" about 60 times, i beat her to the parking lot, she says a im good when i text her saying wan me to come or not, so i leave, at a four way stop, she spots me, rips through a stop sign almost hitting my car, so i was pissed and went bback to see what her problem was, she ignored me. 

couple days later, i wanted to settle it, so i text her, then she texts me back going off how i stalk her and act like shes my girlfriend..
the thig is she always texted me first, she was te one 8 times out of 10 asking me to do stuff for her and go places with her. 

So i said fuck it im done. deleted and blocked her out of my life, I was feeling really depressed the first few days, then i was happy for a day or so, then i found out the truth. 

(note i was close to her family and good friends with her brother, e also shared allot of mutual friends) SO i found out she went and told our mutual friends, that i stalk her and was desperately in love with her. She also told her co-workers so i can no longer go to that walmart, allot of our mutual friends no longer talk to me, the ones that do say they believe me but dont want to get ivolved and stand up to her. She told her family, none of them talk to me anymore, infact i think they spy on my social media profiles. So the fact my public image was scratched like that hurts allot. now its a week after everything cooled down and someone i follow on twitter mentioned her, so i viewed the thread and lone behold they are ""subtweeting"" me and making false accusations of me, such as stalking. that word hurts. 

I know this sounds like a rant but, i feel so alone i feel like i did those few years back, both my hands are marked up badly from punching a wall. I feel like im i this social trap of lonliness where everyone around me is judging me, Im not saying im a saint because i laughed at people she told me about in her past, but now i realize they are probably just her other vcitims. i feel like i deserve this, i feel so much rage like i want to kill her. but at the same time kill myself, i feel sorry to those aroud me, i feel pathetic for writing this, i spent so much money to help her, her family owes me money that ill probably never see because of this. I feel so much fucking rage. FUCKOKJVliewg writing this is making me more upset, the fact i cant talk in person to aanyoe i was fucking calm now i can barely think or type. im sorry. ",suicide

65743,"Talking to Girls So early today I was talking to a guy who said whenever he talks to girls (platonic), they get creeped out by his high sexual drive and walk away. Let me tell you, unless you are like actually being handsy or saying sexual things, and BEING SEXUAL, no girl will know what level of sex drive you have - especially if all you asked was ‚Äúhow‚Äôd you think about the lecture?‚Äù. If the girl says a one word answer and walks away, that DOES NOT mean she was ‚Äúcreeped out‚Äù by your sexual drive. Then he asked me what he should talk about to girls and I said you have to show your personality more than your interest. He then proceeded to say that I‚Äôm being confusing and that his studying for his law degree was easier than talking to girls...  Just remember guys TPO


T - time


P - place


O - occasion 



This is honestly for everything though making friendships/relationships/talking to people of the same sex and the opposite :x 

Time: Is the girl busy? Is the lecture over and she seems like she wants to go back to her dorms/apartment/next class/whatever? She‚Äôs not going to stay around to talk to a guy she‚Äôs never spoken to before. Periodt. If you continuously strike up a conversation with her, you‚Äôll have better chances in making friends with her though

Place: If you have never spoken to her before, you‚Äôll have a better chance in making friends with her if you approach while she‚Äôs with other people like at a study group/party/club where the only person to talk to is you and the only person to direct the conversation to is you. This can also apply to places where most people don‚Äôt have conservations in. If you have the same class and sit next to each other, talk in class, not in the hallways where both of you are just standing there and not comfortable and blocking people‚Äôs way... or talk to each other at lunch when everyone is going to be eating so there can be breaks in conversation without being awkward 

Occasion: If you have a specific reason to talk to a girl it‚Äôll help the conversation flow easier. There‚Äôs a test coming up? Go talk. Both of you are going to a party? Go talk. Are you at an event? Talk about the event - what you‚Äôre excited about and annoyed about. Is it her birthday? Ask her what she‚Äôs going to do or what she‚Äôs happy about. Also be aware of the opposite. If it‚Äôs 2 hours before her test, I‚Äôm pretty sure she would rather study than talk to you about this game/show/hobby.",non-suicide

232626,"I want to die.If you're reading this you're gonna be a while. I have a lot to say. Tl;dr Although I've had this feeling for as long as I can remember, things were extra shitty from 2013-2016. I wanted to be dead because it would solve all my problems. Even when things are good, I always fall back to the 'I want to stop existing' feeling.


I don't know when this feeling started and to me it has always been a part of me. I guess I didn't think much of it when I was pre-adolescent but since I was about 12 years 'till now (21), this thought has consumed me and is a part of who I am. I have never actively tried to kill myself, but only because I know it would be devastating to my close friends and family. Suicide is a apparently a thing in my family and even though some deny it, it is a trend. A fad. One person kills himself and another is sure to follow. I don't want this for my family, but I also don't want to suffer for the rest of my life. I want to be selfish, but I can't. I've always cared too much about others.


From about 12-15 years I was generally just sad. I know how to seem happy and people would tell me how positive I was all the time. It felt good, but deep down I still felt awful. Nothing bad really happened to me, I think it's just the cards I was given. I knew how to make time pass and I've had several hobbies growing up. Although it's still not too late, I never went to a specialist. Maybe I should have. I just didn't understand the problem and looking back now, I know I wouldn't have been able to explain it right. There's also the stigma and taboo element to it that made it easier to just hide it.¬†


I have a decent amount of friends and have been in two long-term relationships during 2013-2017. They were both good, broke up cause of unrelated issues, and I still talk a lot with my recent ex. We might try again when I get back home. The distance and a tight schedule is what broke us up. I think we can make it work. The point is, I have a good life. Sure, there has been ups and downs, but my life is good. I've been in the military and I'm working on getting an education. I spend the excess time on myself and my hobbies, so I should feel happy. Often I do.¬†


But it ALWAYS falls back to that shitty feeling. There's always something, even when there's not. ""If I was dead right now, I wouldn't have to deal with this anymore"". I can be happy, I feel joy, but I don't like living. I think I may have some mental problems, but I don't want to self-diagnose, so unless I check it out it might be anything and nothing. I tried once, but either¬†I didn't explain myself good enough or something else, cause I didn't feel like I was understood. Things were going kind of good at that moment so I thought it might've gotten better. There were a couple of months where I didn't have this feeling that I wanted to die, but it didn't last. As I rose, the inevitable fall was just getting bigger and bigger.¬†


That's the thing. I'm content with feeling sad and awful because that is just another day, but periods where I feel good always ends up knocking me down again. That's the hard part. The happier I am, the harder it is to live with this. The thought that is always on my mind. I don't understand how it came to this. There's something seriously wrong with me, and it just doesn't make any sense to me at all. I want to be dead. I know I'll end up as a part of the statistics some day. Just another number.¬†


It will crush my family and at least some of my friends. Other people will maybe learn about it from an acquaintance or see a post about and then forget me in a few days. Most will judge me for it, trying to be smart with the ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" and the ""selfishness"" of it. I fight every day, but I'm scared that someday it won't be enough.¬†


I know this sounds like some¬†r/iamverysmart¬†shit, but here we go. I consider myself well above average intelligent. I learn fast, understand complex things faster than a lot of my fellow students do, read a lot, good memory and so on. I speak two languages fluetnly, learning French now and also speak Spanish at a decently advanced level. I don't see myself as superior to or better than anyone, but I think very much. Too much. I feel like I could be a lot more useful with this, but I don't want to. I'm not really sure where I'm going with this, I'm just trying to come up with what can be relevant. Not sure if it's true or something ""smart"" people said to feel better about themselves, but I remember reading something along the lines of ""people with a higher IQ has a greater chance of committing suicide than those who don't"".¬†In my hometown, the people I know of who killed themselves were 2 doctors, 1 lawyer, 1 fireman and 1 professor in physics.


I listen to a lot of music. Many different genres. Music is what gives me the most joy and that safe feeling. Not gonna go into more detail, but music never fails to calm me down when I need it.¬† I also like traveling. After I finish my education, I might move to France. I love the French language and the culture. I have this romanticized idea that this will fix everything for a reason. It probably won't, but it just feels so right.¬†
So why do I still end up with this feeling at the end of the day? My life around me is more than good enough. I don't get it. But I want to be dead. I want to be gone. I just don't enjoy life. Things can give me happiness, but the whole act of just living is so off putting. It sucks. I don't want to exist. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die.

57434,"Dear Suicide Watch, I am at a loss for myself.I am the clich√© strong one. But to this day I am not sure why.

I, as a child watched my family drift away, and return two faced. The actions around myself were never the same around others, even at a younger age I felt this was something I could not respect and instead refused to learn anything about life. I choose instead to spend time to look around me and learn from what I saw, what I felt was right or justified. While this by far does not leave me perfect, it is how I grew and began to learn. 



Years later, as a late teen I began to experiance the joys of watching others go through teenage depression. While I could not myself understand their sadness and suicidal urges, I felt it was truly wrong for someone to feel so sad that it was the only way to get away, so I tried and tried as best I could to bring upon myself sadness and grief, to try and feel emotion which I commonly did not feel. After all I knew only myself, and family could not bring out feelings in me. 

Even after all these years, as anice almost 25 year old today, I see how much of a strange and poor choice that was. For I felt that sadness, and it ate me alive, but I had nothing to lose. Nothing to run from. Nothing to fear or hide, nothing to motivate me to take these horrible feelings over the edge. 

There are days I try to grieve, days I feel empty, numb. But u can't figure out why. I for the longest time have hidden this fact from those I helped out of their siutation, because I felt I was the only thing keeping them around, regardless of if that was true or not then, it has been years since I have had these talks. 

I pretend I live for others, or any other reason I can imagine sounds nice, but in the end, I feel hopeless. 

I am stuck,  here, and now, in a world I distract myself not to stop myself, but so that I can have a moment I'm not thinking there is nothing.  

And I wonder, what if I had a reason? A decision I have the freedom to make. 

I'm not sure I know if this all makes sense. Maybe someone can make sense of me,  or maybe it dosent matter if I go unnoticed. That's up to you to decide, as I no longer have the heart to think for myself.",suicide
310902,"Another year alive, my promise is almost complete.So, if you go through my post history you'll see I posted about a year ago. This is going to be another long post full of self-pity and self-loathing. I'm not the most talented writer, but feel free to laugh with me or at me.

I'm 34 now, I can't believe I've made it this long. I REALLY hate life. I do not recall ever requesting to be born, if I did I surely wasn't old enough to make that decision when I did. I know no one ever gets to ""choose"" whether or not they're born and that's just the very first example of life being inherently unfair. You neither get to choose to be born, and society damn sure doesn't want you to choose when you die.

Before I digress too much let me get back on track. You now know my age, that I hate my life, and probably have put together the fact that I want to die. It won't be this week or next, but soon a promise I made will have been kept, I will not agree(even if it's on her deathbed) to further extend my life. 

When I was younger my mother discovered a close family friend who had committed suicide by shotgun, I don't know whether it was the gruesome scene that stuck with her or the fact that the family friend had made the decision to end his life unilaterally and didn't allow anyone to act to prevent him from doing so that stuck with her, but I promised as long as I had a roof over my head and she was alive that I would not go through with any plans. 

Fortunately(for me) my mother is nearing the end of her life. A few years ago she was diagnosed with Acromegaly, basically a tumor grows on the pituitary gland and causes excessive amounts of HGH to enter the blood stream. It doesn't cause too much damage on its own, but it caused enough problems that she had to have it biopsied. She was also diagnosed with Lupus. 

She's a strong woman, no it's not an oedipus complex or anything. She was a single mom who raised my brother and I virtually alone. My father was around but was never much of a father. He cheated on her, they divorced. She went back to school and became a nurse and despite growing up in(and continuing to exist in) poverty I know that I was loved. 

Because of her, I've avoided most of the major pitfalls in life-drugs, tobacco, gambling, alcohol addiction. I've got a borderline addiction with computer gaming, but I frequently go weeks without touching the computer just to prove to myself that I can.

Anyway I was not the best student. I was too smart for my own good. I always HATED teachers who used to assign tons of homework and say ""If you don't do my homework, you won't pass my tests."" 

Don't get me wrong, I get why homework is given-I always have, it's just I always took that statement as a challenge and I accepted it if the subject was not one of particular interest to me. 

Long story short, I wouldn't do the homework, WOULD pass their tests, ace their finals/midterms and end up passing with a low-mid 70's grade. Towards the end of High School I finally grew up a bit and realized that my stubbornness was only hurting myself, and would not cause the teachers to be honest. I did better in my junior year, and made high honor roll for my entire junior year and the first half of my senior year. Sadly, the damage had already been done and my transcript made me look like an idiot. 

Thankfully, I had never really envisioned college in my long term plans. Back in the 7th or 8th grade there was this test called the Occupational Outlook Handbook which was supposed to help you figure out what you wanted to do with your life. 

I never enjoyed computer programming. I had a buddy that was in to that, the closest I ever got to coding was back when I had an old Tandy and had that spiral bound notebook where you had to manually enter the code for the games BEFORE you could play them. I wish I took more enjoyment from coding, but I've always enjoyed building and troubleshooting them. 

I remember saving up and ordering an AMD K6 166mhz processor, buying the parts and building my first system. First teaching myself what goes where and how everything connected.

 Then firing it up and learning post errors and FINALLY getting it to start up, learning how to format a HDD and install DOS, Windows, an old game Fokker, eventually I got a hold of a game called Descent. Anyway, long story short I LOVED that stuff. 

So when I took this test and it told me about the wonderful opportunities for PC Repair Technicians and the impressive salary(45-60,000 a year) that technicians were supposed to make I was sold. Getting paid to do what you love, that's every mans dream, right?

So, I planned High School out to situate myself to get into the workforce as a technician. My city had this program called BOCES which prepared students for a career right out of high school. They had a ton of different programs from Electricians, Electronics repair, automotive repair, CIS programs, nursing programs, they had a TON of programs. Naturally I saw the CIS program and jumped at the opportunity. My Junior year I began taking CIS I, which sadly was basically a joke. It was a course teaching people how to use Microsoft Office(Word, Excel, Powerpoint, some Access). It seemed more like a course designed to train secretaries and ""Executive Assistants"" but whatever I was learning something about computers. I was not exactly thrilled, especially when my brother went through the program a year before me and was learning about AS400 systems and windows servers. 

I was told when I finally asked about this towards the end of the year that ""some of that"" would be covered in year 2 of the program. I was pissed, but then something happened I never expected. My senior year was coming ahead and the school announced that next year they'd be piloting a one-year program called ""A+ Computer Repair"". I was like a kid in a candy store when I found out. 

I signed up and was(no exaggeration) the best student in the class. I graduated with a perfect score, I'd sometimes skip regular school and stay there to do a double class some days just to learn more. 

I would be sent to other classes that were having computer problems to fix their shit-I once saved a paper a Finish program(single mothers finishing high school) student had on a floppy disk that was corrupted(her 3.5"" disk was failing). 

I opened the file in edit and copied/pasted all that I could into a new file on the HDD. The girl was hot as hell and was so grateful she didn't know how she could ever thank me enough. I felt like a hero and a pig for having a response in my mind that I'd never dare speak. On that day I felt like I was made to do that kind of work.

So I graduated High School on schedule in the year 2001 with a somewhat crappy GPA(except this program where I had 4 quarters of 100+'s). I took my certification exam, got certified and I went out to search for those lucrative ""PC Repair Technician"" jobs I was told were coming and were going to be in such high demand.

Ok, so not very many available in/around Buffalo, NY. I did what I had to do to get some experience and earn some cash. I took a job at one of the first ""Outsourcing Technical Support"" companies, a crappy company called ClientLogic. They handled support for a bunch of different companies from Sony to Iomega to Netzero. I was hired on at Sony. 

I put in the time there, hating it. I was making 8.25 an hour and it wasn't about solving problems, it was about getting people off the phone in under 8 minutes. Call after call of being yelled at, being told how shitty Sony products were. I wasn't just supporting sony PC's, I was supporting their WebTV products, their TV's, DVD players, DSS receivers, and yes their VAIO PC's and laptops. I grew to hate my job, but I was earning experience. Until...

One day I showed up for work and was told they were relocating their operations and closing down their call center. It turns out they were moving to India or the Bahamas, I don't remember- I just remember that was my first encounter with ""outsourcing"" and ""globalization.""

So I moved on and found another(better) job working for an ISP called Adelphia. Long story short I was hired during the beginning of their bankruptcy process. I was told I'd have job security and would be doing technical support with an opportunity to advance through the company.

I did the job and got great performance reviews and helped a lot of customers. Every so often I'd get some crappy supervisor who'd tell me ""It's not your responsibility to fix that, you need to transfer those calls to tier 2"". I was only in tier 1, we were classified as ""reboot monkeys"" by the tier 2's/3's. I refused to wear that label so I fixed everything I could. 

I'd argue with my supervisors, who'd wonder how I managed to keep my AHT so low(so I could earn my bonus) and go so far beyond. Well, I'm not saying I was a great employee, my phone had a lot of problems with calls randomly ""dropping"". One 15 minute call and 1 2 second call creates an AHT of 7:30. I justified it to myself by reminding myself that when I was hired I was told that my job would be to help customers resolve their internet connectivity problems. I was also told that I'd have the opportunity to advance.

Long story short, after 3 years the company was sold off to Time Warner and Comcast and split. Our ""secure"" jobs now weren't. I walked out the day they rebranded us from Tier 1 Support to CCRHSIT1. CCR standing for Customer Care Representative. 

Along with the re-branding came a new QA policy, if I failed to offer to take a credit card payment at the beginning of EVERY call I'd get a Zero QA(which DQ'd me from my bonus for the month and would get me a disciplinary warning/write up). I said to my supervisor ""Fuck this, I was hired as technical support not just customer service. I refuse to ask people for money when the service they're already paying for isn't working"". 

I walked out and about 15 others did as well. Later that day I got a call from that same supervisor offering me my job. The TAC shut down a year later. I was now unemployed and job hunting. I managed to get unemployment by arguing that the position they hired me for no longer existed and I lost my job due to the transition to Time Warner. So I was looking for a new job, and not finding any. There were no computer repair technician jobs to be found.

In 2005 I came out to Las Vegas to see what it was all about and opened the ""help wanted"" section of the paper and saw...jobs.

Needless to say after this I moved to Las Vegas, where I've lived since December of 2006. I quickly found a job after moving with a Tradeshow Technology Rental company. There wasn't a ton of ""PC Repair"" work, but there was a lot of customizing machines, imaging, on-site networking. I got to do some traveling on the companies dime. It was a cool gig. 

I was promoted to Weekend Operations Lead, a SMALL raise along with the added responsibility of overseeing local weekend operations. I was happy.

And then the national economy tanked. The company only made 1.6 million in profit that year instead of the 1.9 million from the year before. The head of the company decided he wanted out of the industry and sold the company to a competitor. Just like that I was unemployed again. Only now the economy was in the shitter and there were no jobs to be had. 

I had to sell my place and move back in with my mother. Even though my place was next door to hers(yes, a trailer) I couldn't afford the lot-rent without a job, so I sold it off. Yeah, good luck trying to date when you're approaching 30, unemployed, and live with your mom. 

Finally, a friend from that past job got me an opportunity at a major casino doing IT Support for the Hotel and Casino(hint, their symbol is a giant Guitar). The pay was nowhere near the 45-60k a year I was promised but it was better than any job I'd had before($18/hour). 

There were tons of new systems and technology to familiarize myself with. I had to learn so much, and I did. IDF locations, Virtual Servers and machines, network monitoring, active directory, the IBM i5 system, and so much more. About 9 months later in early December of 2012 I was called in on my day off along with 4 other employees.

We were told that the new VP of Operations was hired earlier in the year and has decided that the IT department didn't need to be manned 24 hours a day. As such the budget would be slashed significantly. That means personnel cuts. That means we're out of our jobs. Don't worry about the chaos that happens when the night club can't process all of their credit card transactions at 3am because one of them is ""stuck"". Don't worry about the hell that happens when the print server crashes at 3am and NOBODY can print in the entire hotel/casino. But that's ok, because the new VP gets to say that she cut 150+ grand in annual unnecessary costs in the IT department.

No severance package for me(because I wasn't there for over a year), no unemployment either(I was only there about 9 months). And that's when I gave up.

I realized then that there's no longer such a thing as employer-employee loyalty. Gone are the days where you can expect to hold a job for 30 years and then retire. How sad is that, my goal in life was to work for some place at a modest wage, be a good little wage slave and then retire. I couldn't even be granted that dignity. Nope.

Our society's become a place where the only people that have any sense of job security are the people at the top or those who make themselves indispensable to a company. IT support is an industry where that's just not possible. Now you've got entire companies outsourcing their IT to MSO's. Who do everything in their power to drive down the wages. 

So I said fuck it, and I haven't had a job since. I refused to be a part of a system that would use me and discard me like a dixie cup. Secretly I wanted a comet to kill me and put me out of my misery.

I refused to get a job. My mother had an injury and went on workers comp, I still refuse to get a job). She insisted everything be put in my name(so if/when she gets sick and needs hospice they can't force her to sell it). This also means she can't throw me out, because everything on paper belongs to ME. 

I don't defend this, I know I'm being selfish and childish and risking homelessness. They've stopped her workers comp(her lawyer's fighting to get her comp for life, so the insurance company is playing hardball). 

She's worried about not being able to pay the rent and winding up homeless. That would suck, but I don't care. I refuse to be a part of that system. I told her long ago that I wouldn't end my life as long as I had a roof over my head and she was alive. That's it.

We're now living off of her Social Security Disability. A little over 1,100 a month. Rent, utilities, car payment, insurance. SNAP and Medicaid. 

If her comp doesn't get restored soon, I imagine the first thing to go will be my car and the insurance. Then we should be able to get by, barely. As for utilities, we have Cox, I have a phone, she has a safelink minute phone, and we qualified last year for LI-HEAP. 

If the worst case happens and we end up facing eviction she can move back to NY with her friend. I'll just use that 80-grain .40 cal S&amp;W that I've got stored in my safe. I've told her as much. 

I've been to counseling, but I refuse to even try anti-depressants. On the permit to carry concealed weapons there's a question ""Do you currently or have you ever taken Anti-Depressants"". Answering yes to that denies you from being issued a permit.

Additionally, there's been a lot of push and talk about disarming people who are on anti-depressants. They also take away your firearms if you're ever taken in on a 5150 hold. 

My firearm is a part of my ""Exit strategy"" it's elaborate and it insures that the police will find me, not some random housekeeper. If I ever get taken in on a 5150 or lose my firearms another way I'll have to switch to plan B which involves turning a firing range into a bloody mess and traumatizing a bunch of people. Removing my firearm wouldn't stop me, I'm smart enough to know how to gain access to one legally. 

Anyway, I talked to a therapist back in 2014 and laid all this out to her and explained that I am suicidal, but not imminently so(so she isn't required to call 911)because of the promise I made to my mother. Her response ""If something ever happens to your mom, you should give me a call and we'll get you some help"". Are you fucking kidding me, does she think I'm an idiot? I'm telling her I want to die, but won't as long as she's alive and you think I'm going to call you when she dies so you can have me committed-so the police can take my weapons and the doctors can force-feed me pills and evaluate me until I can convince them I'm not a risk to myself. 

She insulted my intelligence, and I called her out on it and told her as much. She smiled...wtf?

A few sessions later, she tells me I should ""go get a job to let my mind focus on other things"". As if it wasn't the never-ending pattern of getting a job/losing said job to no fault of my own that put me in this headspace. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. I'm out. I haven't went back since. 

So now here I am, my mom's health's deteriorating, every day I wake up knowing my mom's one day closer to passing away. I love her dearly and have honored and will continue to honor the promise I made. 

Having said that I will not be granting any deathbed pleas she may make. I know she wants me to go on living, but I don't want to live in this world. 

Even before Trump got elected president I didn't like where this country and the world in general were headed. I didn't like that I was constantly shamed for having my so called ""white privilege"" even though I grew up just as poor as possible.

Even though I watched less-qualified applicants get jobs because of affirmative action. Only for those applicants to quit or get fired a week later and see the same job opening back up. I didn't like that globalization and automation were utterly decimating jobs, leading to staggering levels of unemployment(and the creation of a class of people like myself who have been unemployed for so long we're now excluded from the unemployment percentage). Those jobs that remained after automation and globalization are now so heavily in demand by applicants fresh out of school or recently unemployed that wages have become a race to the bottom. A culture has been created where we should ""just be grateful to have a job"" even though the jobs suck, the pay sucks, the benefits suck, you're constantly under threat of being terminated by terrible bosses. 

I hate that it seems like I want my mother to die. I don't, I love her dearly. I just refuse to be another cog in the machine called ""society"". I wish we lived in a world with an implemented UBI, so I could actually just focus on enjoying my life or doing something with my life and time instead of hating myself for being alive. 

I realize my behavior is that of a damn parasite. 

Let's talk ""romance and sex life"" for a moment, I've had 1 girlfriend in my entire life. She was my first everything, she also cheated on me and I was dumb enough to take her back about 6 different times over our 3 years together. 

Eventually she got pregnant by another guy, that's when we finally ended it for good. I've had sex in total with about 7 different woman in my life. 5 of which were prostitutes. I'm no Brad Pitt. I'm fat, have a hunchback(from having to walk home while lugging about 50 pounds of books every night during my freshman/sophmore years of high school.) Oh about those prostitutes I mentioned, I once disgusted a prostitute to the point where she made a sound indicating she was repulsed when I sweat on her face during the missionary position. Not saying that was traumatizing, but for fuck sake. 

I realize that many of you may be judging me, some may be laughing at me, and others may have platitudes to offer to try and cheer me up, I appreciate you reading all of this, I realize it's been a giant wall of text with no TL;DR. Having said that, I don't think anything you have to say will help. 

You may think I need anti-depressants, and maybe according to some doctors I do. Then again maybe I'm just an example of a genetic mutation that should be removed from the gene pool of our species. ",suicide

I drive a white car. I worked years for it. When my family‚Äôs out, I plan on getting my car in the garage, shutting all the doors and running it. I‚Äôd grab a few thick-tipped black sharpies as my car runs, and I‚Äôd write all over it. I‚Äôd write how I felt. I‚Äôd write the names of those I‚Äôd loved during my life, the ones who helped me through the hardest of times. I‚Äôd write apology letters to them. I‚Äôd write the things I loved about them most, and the people I looked up to. I‚Äôd write to my parents and my siblings. I‚Äôd write to my remaining grandparents. 
I‚Äôd just write.

And when I‚Äôd feel tired and my ‚Äúnote‚Äù would be complete, I‚Äôd just lay down and go to sleep.

21095,"Your Bucket List (good intentions)So I'm as suicidal as any of you, but I have decided I want to live a little more before I die. That in mind, I'm making a bucket list, which you're welcome to add to or borrow.

-I've already traveled enough (9 non-US countries) to satisfy my ""travel bug,"" so that's not really a big thing--I have also lived outside the US--though if you haven't been outside the US I strongly urge you to do so. Gives you a lot of perspective. 

-(Cage) diving with Great White Sharks off the coast of San Diego/Mexico. The idea of being so close to Jaws used to scare me, but considering what forum this is, vicious, deadly sharks really don't scare me at all anymore. Hell, I'll go diving with Great Whites without a cage if they will allow me. An alternate is swimming with Whale Sharks. Personal preference I suppose.

-Skydiving. Again, I used to fear the idea of falling out of a plane thousands of feet in the air. Now, the idea doesn't seem so scary. 

-Ziplining-I have done this in Costa Rica. It's fun and a great experience to have.

-Running with the Bulls in Spain. I had thought of doing that this past July, but scheduling prevented it. Maybe I will see if there is something like this to do in the US in the near future

-Running for a political office. I wanted to do this, but ended up moving abroad instead. Don't care if I would've won. Still would've been a fun hustle. 

-On a similar note: starting a revolution (or at least protesting). I went to the March for Science in April 2017. It was very interesting to see so many people gathered together NOT for entertainment or the hopes of buying a product, but for their own beliefs. Before I die, I think it would be fun to start my own yellow vest movement here in the US regarding all the tomfoolery in the US government/capitalist society at large. People would call me crazy, but they'd call me crazy anyways for being suicidal.

-Learning a new language (verbal or programming). I know some programming languages and Spanish, so that's checked off the list.

-Working a corporate office job. One of my great regrets. I would've had fun being an office employee and know I could've brought a lot of energy and new, diverse ideas to a big workplace. I would've been the circle in the square hole (probably why I never found my way into a cubical). I'd always relished the challenge of turning a cubicle job into something stimulating and entertaining for myself and potential co-workers. Oh well.

-Eating lots of delicious food. I have eaten reasonably priced, but extremely tasty meals in France, Hong Kong, Japan, and obviously America. I am satisfied here. 

-I did not include any sort of sexual/romantic things on this list, because sex/romance (or the lack of it) is my whole reason for being suicidal in the first place. And I am strongly against the usage of prostitutes. I would literally rather kill myself than have paid sex.

-Hiking to the summit of Mt. Everest. Would be cool (literally), but too damn expensive.

-Having an encounter with Nessie/Bigfoot/aliens. Always loved conspiracy stuff. I don't think these things are necessarily real, but would've loved to have ""seen Bigfoot.""

-Driving a really nice car. I may consider renting a Lamborghini in Vegas. We'll see.

Remember that if costs are ever an issue-put it on a credit card-you'll never have to pay it off! Anyways, please add to my list or post your own. It can small things too, like having a chat with an old friend you haven't seen in years or resolving an old grudge.",suicide

66814,"I guess I just want to know why I shouldn'tHope you don't mind my using a throwaway account.

Well, I should start by saying I'm constantly fearful. I've never actually felt very secure in life. And as life speeds up, things get less and less familiar to me, I begin to feel ever more unsure. Much more fearful and worried. 

Well, I'm at the stage in life when one applies for Graduate school. 

A few weeks ago I had a burst of enthusiasm about it hoping that I could pacify the desires of my parents to see me become a graduate -- I made significant progress with one university in particular and I was quite happy (if not very scared) of this. 

But my dad just came to me now, with a tone of seriousness and perhaps disappointment that I'd never heard him use before. All this progress I thought I made, in spite of my constant fears and worries, was for nothing. He hates the university I'm going to, he hates that I'm trying my best. He said I didn't try hard enough -- he cannot know that I'm legitimately up every night scared out of my mind at how quickly life is going and how little control I feel I have. It must seem stupid. Petty even. 

Anyways, he really tore into me about it and I hate myself for feeling like a disappointment. 

He really wants me to go to another school. I looked into their graduate requirements. I have none. Not to mention the deadline for application to fall semester is a month past. I'm fucked, basically. 

On top of everything else, I'm gay and closeted. My dad -- I respect him a lot despite this -- is a homophobic man. It's just how it is. I am neglecting my own wants for a boyfriend just to pacify his sincere hatred for people like me. I'm really lonely. I must sound perfectly pathetic, I feel like such an idiot even having these stupid issues. 

Basically, all I can think about now is how much better things will be if they just ended. I don't believe in an afterlife, so ending it will not disrupt some higher cosmic plan or anything in my opinion. Mostly, I just want to escape being fearful all the time, hiding my 'other lives' from my friends and family, disappointing everyone, get away from all these things I cannot control and just find a peace of mind for once. I just hate that I should feel this way. Wanting to end it whereas so many in lesser positions in life are happy as can be. I feel so fucked up and defected.

I'm just ranting because I don't feel any reason why I shouldn't. I don't inspire happiness in anyone else, let alone myself, I don't have any reason not to just give up. I don't have any friends who care enough, anyways. Not like anyone would really notice. 

P.S. It turns out that my dad -- who is my boss as well -- is now so annoyed, angry, and frustrated that he's yelling at everyone in the office over things. I know this is my fault. I just ruined everyone's day. Suddenly I just cannot feel like killing myself would be anything less than a complete positive. ",suicide
31247,"My first attempt will be very soon.For a solid year I have told myself things will get better, and they continuously get worse. I pushed every single friend I have away due to depression and now I have no one left. I broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years months ago and it was the biggest mistake of my life and he won't even speak to me. I wasn't in a good state of mind when I did it and I thought I was doing what was best for him because of how fucked up i am. The only person I was close to was my mother and she left. She had to go to rehab. She's been gone for months. I go days without talking to anyone. In fact, I don't think anyone would notice my absence for days if not longer. I have a shitty job that I hate. I can't drive because I have no one to teach me. I live with my brother and father and it's terrible. My relationship with my dad isn't too good. My brother literally never speaks to me and avoids me. The only thing that makes me happy is my cat. I've struggled with depression my entire life and I'm tired of fighting when it never pays off. Mental illness runs deep in my family. My mom is severely bipolar and I think I am too. I told my therapist my symptoms and she just gave me a weird look and didn't even acknowledge what I said. I've tried to get help. I'm a burden on everyone. I try not to even talk to anyone because I'm so depressing I just stress them out. The only reason I haven't ever attempted was because of my mom and how heartbroken she would be...  but I learned something. She tried to kill herself multiple times while I was growing up and I didn't know. She didn't care what that would have done to me. Why should I care then? I feel like now is the perfect time since she is away. I don't even care about the physical pain anymore. I want to do it. I think my whole life has been leading up to this.

271871,"Not sure where to start...I guess I'll start here... f(23) my fiance m(35) left me on Halloween, and we've been together for two years up until that point. I have a 2 year old son from another relationship... and him and I started dating when my little one was a couple of months old. My son looked up to him, my son got attached, and was the only father figure he had, since his biological father walked out on us upon finding out about the pregnancy. 

My fiance whom just left the relationship wanted a child with me. I wanted one with him. Now I'm 6 weeks pregnant, and he's gone, over something trivial. My ex came back in the picture a month ago to try to start up a relationship with his son. My fiance was not cool with that, and I was going to take my son out with my ex trick-or-treating, since Halloween is a holiday you can't exactly split between two days, and being two years old, he would get tired after a half hour. So, upon hearing this, he silently packed his things, and took off. He told me that he really wasn't sure that I'm committed enough (he's probably insecure) and said he found someone else anyways. I feel like used up trash. I have sacrificed so much for him, I would have given him the world. I quit smoking because he was allergic, I gave up time with my friends just to be with him, and I gave up even aspects of my personality. 

Now he's gone, and Halloween night I took my son out, I found his number on my call display 7 times within an hour. I guess I missed my chance of reconciliation. I have been trying to call him back, but to no avail. Am I that worthless to him? I don't even know if he even loved me. I have mixed feelings, because he would always buy expensive jewellery for me, despite my numerous protests, and I don't think someone would do that if they weren't totally committed. Throughout the relationship, I have noticed slight traits of narcissism in him, but sloughed it off as normal ego. He never once hit me, never even raised a hand to me. 

He treated me the best out of every relationship I've ever had, then suddenly left me at a moment's notice, with little to no foreshadowing . He wasn't dissociating, wasn't distancing himself, never even had any arguments or serious talks. This is all surreal to me, and I have been dumped off into an unknown world with questions which need answering, which he refuses to answer due to his non-communication. 

I have suffered depression in waves since a child, being a child of abuse and drug-using parents, turning into a drug-using adolescent, then into a severely depressed adult, until I met him. I was even okay not taking my meds because he brought me to life, and haven't had even one wave of depression since we've been together. He brought out a youthfulness and I was vibrant and alive. Now that he's gone, I feel empty, lost, and alone. I feel like a stone stuck on the edge of a rough river, wondering which wave will be the one to suck me under.  

Every time I know I will go home to an empty bed, an emotionally empty, cold place in which I used to feel comfort in his arms. I feel I can't give my son the affection he needs, and my son feels that. He has been irritable and restless, and he misses my fiance, his father figure. I have even considered that night getting back into heavy duty drugs, but my son was in his bed and I couldn't follow through. Now that my son's father is back in his life, I feel I have nothing to lose anymore. My fiance is clearly not coming back, I just want to talk to him one last time if it's not reconcilable, just to get the answers. My heart literally feels broken, I can cry over this anymore before I start bleeding from the tear ducts, I can't sleep, I can't eat. I just stare blankly off into the distance. What is the use of existence after this? Everyone will say ""what about your son?"", but it's easier said than done. My head is in the fog right now, and I see no light in the distance. Going back on my meds is not an option, since it can affect the pregnancy, but even that is trivial at this point. 

It feels like it may have meant nothing to him, but it meant everything to me. I have never been codependent on anyone before, I may have entered depression after the end of a relationship, but no one has ever driven me to this point like he did. It's more a question of if he ever loved me, or was it based on lies? Did he lie to me all along? Is he even capable of it? Because I thought he loved me through his affection, actions, and being there for me, not to mention wanting to start a biological family with me. I am up in the air right now, suspended. I am waiting until the weekend, and if nothing clears up, I'm gone. I can't take this feeling any longer, I just want to waste myself. 

Any help with this feeling would be much appreciated, because I can't help myself. I need to be here with my son, but the feelings are overwhelming. Yesterday I almost, on impulse, jumped into traffic a few times, but restrained myself with every fiber of my being.

197456,"life shouldn't be this hard8 months ago, shortly after graduating college, I left the country having gotten my dream job that I had wanted since I was 14 years old. When I got there, it turned out to the be the opposite of anything I thought. I got food poisoning and heat stroke the first week I was there. I may have had a UTI as well. An old back injury flared up because I had no bed. My apartment was filled with cockroaches. No one would talk to me except when I was at work and even then, they used a dialect I couldn't understand and it was very hard. I had no car, no phone, no internet. There was no public transit near to me. I wanted to kill myself but I decided to come home instead. I thought it would be better. Some things are. I am no longer sick off all food I eat, but my eating disorder came back. I feel like a failure all of the time. I went back to school and it's really hard. I failed a class fall semester and I'm struggling with taking it again this semester. I couldn't get a job for months after I got back and when I did, it was strenuous (in a school cafeteria). I had to quit. Now I suffer from chronic pain. I can't work. I'm in pain all of the time. I live with my parents and must commute to school by bus 1 hour each way, 5 days a week. I have no car. I have no money. I am running up a bill on my credit card, it's over a thousand dollars already. I also have over 40 thousand dollars in student loan debt. My eating disorder screws with my head all of the time. I feel fat. I am fat. None of my clothes fit me at all. I am literally scared to get up in the morning because I know I have nothing to wear other than sweat pants and sweat shirts. I have no money for clothes. I try to exercise but I am tired and weak all of the time. I could eat 3000 calories a day and I would still not have energy for even half the day. I go to the doctor quite often. I take 8 or 9 prescriptions daily for various diseases. My body fails me. My life is a mess. Maybe I'm not taking a knife to my wrist, but the option of lying in bed and never ever getting up again becomes harder to resist every day. Or maybe take too many of the prescription pain pills that never dull my pain. Everything hurts all of the time, emotionally and physically. It's getting harder to fight.",suicide

167771,"Tonight, I'm finally going through with killing myself. AMA.Hi.

I'm sick and tired of it all.

The usual suspects: 

* I'm a 22 year old straight male from western Europe. No money problems. No girlfriend, a few FWBs.
* There are medical reasons for my suicide, but I won't clarify them because I know some people I know read reddit, and the last thing I need is for one of you fuckers to ""save"" me. 
* I've had concrete suicidal thoughts for at least three years. Pretty much permanently depressed for as long as I can remember.
* Yes, I sought help. First my regular doctor, then a psychiatrist. Attended for half a year. Kept describing someone else's problems to me.
* Yes, I've tried contacting a hotline. They were busy. Great. Doesn't really matter, since I wasn't planning on letting them change my mind. I've had three years of this shit already, I don't need any more.
* I realize I will leave people behind that will be hurt my by actions. Tough shit. There's a few people of which I *hope* what I'm going to do will fuck them up.
* My preferred method changed from drug cocktail to shooting to hanging. Shooting isn't an option because acquiring a gun here is ridiculously hard. Hanging is preferred to a drug cocktail, because it's more disturbing to the people most likely to find me. Hanging is done from an attic window. I have an old bed as a counterweight. Rope, with noose, is prepared. Suitable length for my height and weight computed. It's at least as good as I can get it given the information I could find.

I'm sick and tired of people telling me crap like ""chemical imbalance"" and ""irrational decision"". Fuck you. Life consists of good things and bad things, and the good doesn't even come close to outweighing the bad for me. I don't care that there's some girl I'm going to meet, or some incredibly rewarding activity I'm going to miss out on. It's all pointless hedonism. None of it is permanent. We're specks of dust. We get born, go through a load of crap, and die. I want to skip the load of crap part.

I'm sick and tired of random people telling me they ""love"" me, when they ostensibly haven't met me and have no clue what I'm like.

Other than that, AMA. ~~Limited time offer.~~

Right now I am in an outpatient program (I was inpatient before that), and I'm terrified. I have horrible suicidal thoughts every time I go home, but when I'm at the program I'm fine. My new medication is upsetting my stomach even more than how my stomach usually is and I was told to tolerate it for a couple more weeks and see if it will stop. They want me to go home for good in a couple weeks and that's even after I bargained for more time. My mom is spending tons of money for me to stay in a motel and drive a couple hours back and forth on the off days from home to the program. I'm beyond anxious and I feel like there's no solution to my problems and I feel like such a burden to my mom and it's driving me crazy. I feel like I have no future, I'm 20 and I don't have a job, I'm not in school, I don't know what I want to go to school for (maybe I want to be a therapist, maybe that's what I think I SHOULD do because I think my life has no worth if I don't help people, I dunno), I don't know if I could even handle school (I suffer from severe undiagnosed fatigue issues and also some GI issues from taking antibiotics for a year and I could only manage to take one class a semester when I was going), I think I should probably go to school away from my family to get out of my shitty area and house and to become more independent and reduce distraction, but I have this fear that by leaving my parents I'm going to regret leaving and losing that time with them when they die which is very overwhelming, aaaaaand lastly I have only one friend who I met through the program but they live hours and hours away from me so I'm struggling to accept that too because I already feel attached and I'm trying to find reasons to stay in the area afterwards (like going to school in the area) just so I can be close friends with them and hang out all the time.

I had very few friends, but I don't really think this did bother me at the time, for they were good friends.
By June 2012 I fell in love with a girl two years older than me who lived in another state. We talked a lot through the internet for two months or so, until things started to get very heated and she decided we should stop talking. 

During those two months, I lost my study habits. In the months that followed, things got worse and, by mid-2013, I was already depressed, lonely, and spending whole days and whole weeks on Reddit and, later on, 4chan.

In these last two years I gradually came to the realization that I am not, in fact, smart. Or at least not smarter than the average slightly educated person. I also came to the realization that all my dreams and goals are ultimately unattainable, and in most likelihood I shall never be more than a failed, lazy wage slave with extremely low self-steem, living in a third world country with no hopes of improvement.

In addition to that, I have lost contact with my old friends. And I need friends. But now I don't even know whether I really am capable of holding a real, genuine friendship anymore.  The vast majority of my communication with other people happens in anonymous websites on the internet and I have lost the hability to talk to people normally in real life. In social settings, I tend to isolate myself and act very awkward.

I also cannot stand the city where I live, which is something that in my case has a serious impact on my well-being. I love good architecture, I love walking, I love museums, I love music concerts. These things are almost essential to my life, and my city offers none of it: the architecture is made of ugly concrete boxes, the climate is too hot for me to take a walk (30 to 35 C is the usual temperature during the day), the museums are poor, and good concerts are rare.

I am 19 years old. I am a short man - 5 foot 8 (173cm) -, overweight (82kg), my face is full of acne, and I have never dated a woman in real life or had sex. 

I have been living the same daily routine for a quite some time now: wake up, go to uni, come back home, buy food, eat, watch some movie, read something, waste time on the internet, sleep, and repeat. I can't bear it.

When I look at the life of the people I know they are all doing better than me: the girl I fell in love with is a psychology student at the best university in the country and is now full of friends and seems to lead a very happy life, her boyfriend is an engineering student at the same institution who in ten years will probably be making ten times more money than I ever will, one of my old acquaintances is a photographer and dates a beautiful young journalist, the other is a young filmmaker, another one is living in a beautiful city in Germany, and the other is working for Apple and making a lot of money. When I first met them I was very smart, hardworking, dedicated to my passions, and capable. Now they all developed their potential and are doing well, while I have become lazy and depressive, and am overall a worse creature than I used to be. They have improved themselves, I have worsened myself.

Suicide has been on my mind quite frequently since 2013. There is no way I'm going to do it now or in the following months or years, because I could never deprive my parents of their only son. However, I do sincerely believe that my death will happen by suicide, probably when I'm around my 30's or 40's. I despise myself and I do not think I am worthy of this world, of my family, of my country, or even of this ugly, small, fat shell which I call my body. 



tl;dr: I was a smart student, fell in love, became depressed, wasted my late teens on the internet, have no friends, no self-steem, live in a city I hate, and the reason why I haven't killed myself already is that I love my parents.",suicide

224915,"Venting outDisclaimer: I made this account for this specific post only. I've never had written here before as I explain it in the post itself, neither as a help-seeker nor as a help-giver.

So, here I am, never did I think I'd end up on this end of the stick. I've always tried to help people, to help them make it, to make them believe in themselves, to make them determined, to be there for them, to hear them out, to talk, to show them there always is someone who cares, even be it a total stranger like me. 

It's been a long road, were I to hazard a guess I'd say I've been doing this for the past 6 years or so. A lot of things happened, I've made few international friends some of which are still grateful  to me, others I don't speak to much more, but they are always there. But never before had I planned to share my own feelings and pains.

You see, I've said that many things changed, but one thing did not. Motives. I've always found helping others out a way to ease my mind, to forget about my own problems. It was like an escape mechanism. I've spent many a sleepless nights just to forget, but it became like an addiction. Every night or so I'd fall into depression, heavy mood swing. I've always felt like a huge disappointment. People said I was an intelligent child, they tried to push me further, to encourage me, but every time I tried and something failed - I felt like a disappointment, like if I failed them.

I've lived my life under one roof with my mother and grandma, father I've met once I think, when I was 19, so a year ago. we've both decided then not to talk to each other anymore and forever part our ways. I have a loving and sweet girlfriend, but I constantly feel like a disappointment, like a failure, like a lesser human being. I've talked to her about it, she always stands by my side, but even though I know she means it when she says I'm not a failure I can't bring myself to believe in it.

Self esteem, eh? Never heard of it I guess... I'm not good at anything, for a long time I didn't find any support from my peers or closest family. Being honest, the only supporter I think I had, and have right now, throghout my whole life is my girlfriend. And she's the sole reason I can't give up, I don't want to be an ultimate failure, to be her biggest mistake, to hurt her.

And this place where I live, small house in the country, away from cities where everybody at the age of 10-20 talks about cultivation of the land on their farm? They don't read anything, they don't watch movies, they have no intrests that I could even remotely share with them. Not only that, they always laughed at me for ""wasting my time on the books"". I'd love to travel but both family and those nearby neglected my own intrests and dreams - even the smallest ones - always talking about learning, then studying, then finding good job. And you know what, I've always wanted to be a psychologist, to run away from the place I live in, maybe to another country. Hell, everyone besides my girlfriend keeps telling me ""Don't study psychology, you won't get a job. Go study engineering, you're so good at maths and physics"" etc. etc. I want to run away, to leave everything behind, to begin my journey anew. Only then, I think, I'll be free, I'll feel happiness. Happiness, I don't think I even know how does it feel anymore...

I know it's not everythting I probably want to talk about, it's all pretty shallow. I could go deeper with it but it doesn't matter. Explaining things wouldn't make me less of a failure. I'll go back to talking for - that's the only thing I'm decent at. I'll try to do my best, for those who seek help and someone to talk and for you, Alex, my loved one. I never make promises I may not be able to keep, so I won't say everything will be fine with me. But I'll try.

Edit: I think I've missed out one important thing. I almost never share my problems with others. I'm scared, afraid that they will leave me. That I'll be too much of a weightt for them to support me. That I, who always is there to help, will fail them and will seek help myself... I just don't want them to be sad because of me...",suicide

Well, I really don't know  if it will work out or not, but right now I want to check if she added me, declined the friend request or straight up blocked me and I am also really scared to do that. So, should I check it? If she declined it or even blocked me again, I guess I will try to commit suicide and it's going to be just enough reason to do it, because it will just stack up on top of my other problems in life and other really bad stuff that I don't like.

I ended up lying to her and saying that I haven't thought about doing it. I feel bad. I just didn't want her to worry even more.

She asked me to tell my therapist because I've never spoken about it before. I've been scared and I don't want to be hospitalised. I can also only afford three more therapy sessions so I don't know what's the point in coming forward with it at this point.

I feel like I might mention it at therapy today, but downplay it a bit. I don't think I'm a danger to myself currently. I'm not actively planning anything. I wouldn't do it to the people I love.

After 18 I was away from them and things seemed to be getting better but the depression was always there and still nightmares of the past. Everyone on the outside had no clue what I been through or that I was down. I faked being happy almost my whole life. Now I'm 27 and tired of it.

Throwaway cause people know my main account. I apologize in advance for the length story but I don't know what do anymore. I don't have anymore fight left and I want to give up.


Some background, a year ago I went through a really traumatic experience that led to a PTSD diagnosis. I was still in university at the time but because of the PTSD I failed my classes which delayed my graduation a year and had to petition to be let back into the school. I thought life was going great because I thought I had finally overcome everything. I was given a new slate at university, I had just finished a prestigious internship, and I was ready to take on the new year.


So now, I go to register for classes and I find that I can't because of a hold. Find out my hold is for a past due balance because the loan I had taken out expired before I submitted a missing part (was never told the expiration date). I try to talk to the FinAid office but there's nothing they can do since the only loans that can cover past due balances do not work for me (no one in my family has good credit). The balance is something I could never pay out of pocket. So not only is it looking like I won't graduate this year but it's looking like I'll never graduate and achieve my dreams.


I feel like I'm watching everything I spent my whole life working on slip away. I don't know what do. I feel so lost and scared. Ending it all is looking a better and better option.

I'm recently married to a wonderful lady. I have fantastic parents. No debt. Good health. I am in good standing in my program, and I have a job offer for when I graduate. So why am I getting these thoughts? Is it the 80-hour workweek with no sign of reprieve? Am I imaging all the other students hating me? Why don't my advisers ever seem satisfied with my work? Why do they treat me and my time like it is worthless? I always feel rushed and, consequently, incapable and irresponsible. Is this real or just an unreasonable environment? Is this all be compounded by being many, many thousands miles away from home?

No one knows it, but I am struggling. They all think I am making leaps and bounds in my work. I am. But I am falling fast. The only reason I haven't off'd myself is because of what how my family would take it. It would not be not fair to them. I owe them more than that, but if they were to disappear, so would I.

I tell myself this is only for a limited duration, that it will all be OK once I graduate, but could I be dealing myself some kind of long-term mental harm by being in a program that is so bad that I consider ending my life just to escape it?

I want to go home, but if I do that now, I'll be seen a failure.

I've kept fighting, but I've been naive to think it will resolve to any sort of life that I can live. Had things been a bit different, had I been more selfish or just a tiny bit less concerned with other people's feelings I think I could be living a good life by now. I could have meaningful relationships, work, community. But my options have been whittled down over the past five years as I've shied away from hurting anyone, letting my empathy be used against me, letting myself be exploited - and not even for anyone's significant gain.

I'm leaving Monday. I've thought about finding renting an apartment where things have opened up more. There's a decent chance the virus will affect me badly. But at least I could be around people again for a while, even if I don't get to find any real relationships before I make an exit. I don't know. I've dreamed about swimming out in to the ocean or just heading up into the mountains to die, and those seem like real options now.

186157,"Dealing with suicidal tendenciesThe title isn't quite fitting I'm sorry. Hopefully this description will bod more light.

For years I (F20) have been suffering with depression and an eating disorder. My poor relationship with my family, and their toxic dynamic, as well as external stress from unfullfilling excessive work hours as a waitress and a uni course I don't enjoy have had their toll on my wellbeing. 

I am also in a relationship, which is private and I feel terribly guilty about. We aren't public because our families would react terribly and this is our decision. I wasn't the pursuer of this relationship, but im grateful for this opportunity. This relationship is worthwhile and is the only thing really keeping me going, despite my onset suicidal tendencies. We work together at the same family- run place.

I have been incredibly stressed and this has had a massive impact on me mentally and physically. I feel like a shell of who I used to be. In the past few months these tendencies have almost gotten unbearable and I can't stop fantasising about killing myself. I see little to no purpose in my life, despite previously being so enthusiastic about traveling for instance. This is no longer possible due to financial constraints. 

Controlling what I eat has been the only thing I have felt I have had control over, until I was diagnosed with IBS and anemia. 

An extended family member of my partner has just committed suicide and this has had a terrible impact upon his (M25) family. Long story short his ex (mother of his 3 year old child) is trying to exclude his family from the funeral and raise money without them. This is absolutely devastating for them.

I want to get better I really do. I know the impact suicide can have upon a family. My uncle, who suffered with paranoid schizophrenia, committed suicide when I was 6 years old.

I don't live with my parents. I have moved out, as they are moving away. My mum nearly died due to sepsis around my 20th birthday and this has added immensely to my stress and you could say quarter life crisis if you will.

I mean it's not that big of a deal but like I have 9 classes everyday for 5 days +extra classes. I need some break too. 

my twin brother has better grades than me and the ""equality"" my parents gives us makes my heart flutter ‚ò∫/sarcasm. not long ago a mail sent to my mom about how I didn't attended a class and didn't done my homework which I did but turned in late and I even attended my class. and after online classes ended my mom slammed my door open and yelled at me ""What the hell are you think you're doing? why didn't you attend your class and didn't done your homework!? "" and I was panicking while trying to stay stable. after my mom slammedy door again to my face saying ""think about what you have done I'm gonna talk with your father when he gets home"" and after she closed my door I had a panic attack and thought ""I should end it all rn"" so I texted my friends that I can't take it anymore and stuff but in the end didn't do it. but when my mom gets an e mail that says your son did done his 4 or more (not sure) homeworks she didn't even get mad ahh yes ik I'm just the useless dumb one but you didn't bad to smear it to my face. my mom gets angry at everything I'm sure that she tries to find things to get mad over so she can yell at me. 

maybe like I said I'm just an ungrateful little bitch and my parents are right. if my parents are really good people then my death will be like a holiday for them no angsty teen with her nagging, no extra spending money, no extra work. either way my death would be better for everyone I know. I'm not even sure that my friends even still like me. I just annoy them but cuz I'm just a pitiful person they can't say that to my face.

222387,"Do you also feel that you are stuck in a loop?A loop of unhappiness. I guess feeling trapped is common in this situation.

Then there is your brain urging you to somehow get unstuck. At this point I only know one sure way to break the loop. I very much detest the idea of giving up, but it sure seems and feels the only way out. Sometimes even the preferable way.

But how can you achieve anything if you can't even trust your own thoughts and feelings? And what happens when you are too exhausted to go on?

Maybe I'm just having a particularly bad day I can't share with anyone. That's kind of my fault. I don't want burden other people.

But in the end of the day there is just you being trapped in your skull. Everything outside of it is fuzzy and distant. There is nothing but the darkness. You can't live in it. You cannot build or create anything in it. There is no up or down here. There aren't any directions. There isn't anything that can be used as a leverage to propel yourself.

In this cloud of inability and inaction sometimes there is only one thing I can do. Planning the big escape, even though I don't want to die, and trying to come up with ideas, so at least I can make other people understand why.

I also want to understand why. I'm curious why we function this way, and why this happens to me. If I would have cancer I would be curious about it as well. How it works, why does it happen. All that stuff. But I guess this isn't the same. You can't decide against cancer. Cancer just happens to your body.
Yet what's frightening me is that sometimes I feel that I can't decide against suicide either. It can just happen.

And that's the thing. I don't want it to happen. I hoped that if I know why it happens I can be safe from it. But after that I also found how it can happen and now that I have access I feel more unsafe. It would be better if I could do something about that, but there is no way. 10 second of letting my guard down would be bad enough.

That's why I hate when a short-time crisis like this just hits. Because normally, like most of the times things are somewhat managable. Yet my life these days seems nothing but a loop of going forward and breaking down.

I love to cook and bake.  I used to do that all the time and when I tasted it, it was amazing.  My husband would try it and he would say it was delicious, but then he would never eat any of it.  Then something switches in my mind.  
I don't eat anymore of it.  It's not really that good.  I can't eat it anymore.  It's just going to make me fat.  Then it slowly goes in the garbage along with a little more of my spirit.  I barely eat anything for days.

Other days he would go on about what an amazing cook his mom is and no one can top her baking skills.  Then he goes on to brag about how his coworkers come close to his moms cooking. His mom is amazing, his coworkers are amazing.  
All of these women in his life are just perfect and he rants and raves about them all the time.  I'm just... the girl he married.

I can't talk to him.  I have tried.  He gets so defensive and it just goes downhill from there until we stop talking for days.  I don't eat anything for days.  I wake up, go to work, come home, then go to sleep.  My dreams are the only relief I can find.

Short version:  Joined the Army last year in order to get my financial shit in order (I have a useless undergrad degree, was on food stamps, have $45k in student debt). I hate it.  In June my grandmother who I loved dearly died, suddenly, a week before her 90th birthday (she'd been talking all year about how she'd be the first in her family to hit 90 and how excited she was for it). Her funeral was on my mom's (her daughter) birthday.  

In August I finished training and ended up stationed in Bumfuck, Germany, in a fucked-up unit that embraces all the stupid bullshit I hate about the Army (basically we're treated like children and everyone's a homophobic sexist dick). I just found out that I'm probably going to be deploying next year, one month before I'm supposed to move on to my next assignment (which should be within the US at least), and I'm a coward so that TERRIFIES me.  I've got this fucking problem with my foot, they don't know what it is but my foot hurts every day, and my leadership makes me feel like a shitbag because I can't run on it. Our housing sucks - I'm 25 and living in a super-shitty dorm room with a roommate and never have any privacy. I basically have no friends here: at home my idea of a nice Friday night was maybe going to a movie, then getting a drink or two and bullshitting about literature and philosophy and things like gender theory all night, and NO ONE here does that.  An aunt is currently in the hospital suffering from major, major health problems. I hate my job. I hate the people here. They're making me take a class to get a military license and I'm scared to death of driving (I was in an accident where someone died when I was a kid, then when I borrowed my mom's car when I was 19 a pedestrian stepped in front of my car [I was going slow] and after that I basically said fuck driving, bad things happen when I do it), but this week I'm going to have to drive a fucking humvee. I'm always stressed and unhappy and were it not for the fact that I could in theory go to jail for it I don't think I'd get out of bed in the morning. I want out of the Army but don't know what I'd do.  I can't go talk to anyone because 1) that's stupid 2) there's no real confidentiality in the military and 3) they'd just tell me I'm fucking stupid; I've never even deployed.  Oh, and I fucking loathe the military-industrial complex, so I wake up every day knowing I'm an immoral sellout who gave up on my ideals for a quick easy buck.

Pretty much the only thing keeping me going is the fact that my parents would be so hurt/embarrassed if I killed myself, and they don't deserve that. I just don't know where to turn, no one even knows how miserable I am because I feel like I need to put on a mask for my friends who all told me not to join.

Everytime I'm left alone with my thoughts, I realise how much I hate myself, and how little I can do about it. I have high sex drive, but I haven't been with anyone in almost 3 years. That frustration is adding to things for me now. I would like to be able to go out, go back to a woman's place, etc. But I can't do that. Even better would be a fwb type deal for me, but I don't know if I could handle her being with other people too. 

I know this is all over the place, but I'm done caring. 
I just want to not exist anymore. There is no reason for me to be around still. I offer nothing to no one. Despite knowing what I can and want to offer, I never get the chance to.

171000,"Not entirely suicidal yet, but I‚Äôve been considering.Don‚Äôt know if anybody is going to read this, but regardless I feel like I need to get this off my chest.

Since this pandemic has occurred it has been very difficult for me to function as I normally do, meaning that I‚Äôm not recognizing myself anymore and this is seriously disturbing me.

Back when everything was normal, I had no concerns in particular and it felt like I was finally accomplishing the things that I always wanted to achieve my entire life, but suddenly when the virus started to circulate around the globe I was starting to have a lot of internal thoughts which which eventually resulted into depressive and suicidal thoughts, but so far I have only been contemplating but I haven‚Äôt considered to actually commit suicide, but I was surely tempted. 

However, one thing I noticed is that I barely have the ability to think clearly, everything I say seems to be senseless or has no important subject matter whatsoever, and since my speech is not as compelling as it initially was it throws people off and usually they do not understand what I‚Äôm trying to explain.

Also when I get unexpected questions I tend to black out completely, as I cannot respond to simple questions anymore. This is the first time that I have encountered such problems, unless I‚Äôm interacting with a person who doesn‚Äôt share the same interests/does not really contribute to the conversation I have no problems in terms of communication, but this has drastically changed since the corona epidemic has started.

Another noticeable problem was that I easily got overwhelmed by everything, to the point where I would remain in bed for several weeks. I cannot function like I normally do, at some points writing paragraphs like these can be quite challenging for me when I do this almost every week. It just feels like my brain is not able to function anymore... sometimes I feel lost and demented... and at other days I tend to be extremely productive.. so you can imagine how frustrating that is for me, to not have a conventional pattern anymore.. just unable to maintain my consistency.

Due to the isolations and the amount of questions that I had regarding my health, I started to do a lot or research to see if any of the symptoms I‚Äôm experiencing correlate to a specific diagnosis, but there were too many results which means that it wouldn‚Äôt be reliable. Meanwhile I still wanted to have answers why I suddenly was so challenged by everything that I do in my daily life so I demanded more answers.

I stumbled across a document which had a lot of clarifications regarding academic performance as a child, once I was reading it I had a sudden ‚Äúrealization‚Äù that this might be the answer to all my problems. It stated that I had several examinations as a child and that they have diagnosed a couple disorders, but frankly these were only estimations and it contained assumptions since they were observing me. This why I thought that it might not apply to today‚Äôs circumstances, but then again they made these estimations and observations for a reason. 

When I was reading more of the file I also came across a section about my academic life, declaring that I have been transferred to two special education institutions because of ‚ÄúADHD or autism‚Äù. This was one of the things that caught my attention in particular because I immediately assumed that this is the evidence that I‚Äôm technically ‚Äúmentally challenged‚Äù, according to the file I have an IQ of 68 and that basically entails that I could not have the future that I have envisioned for myself and it also means that I should think about my career choices (and I probably have to quit with my studies).
I was mortified and devastated ever since I read that document, it made me doubt myself even more and I am more observant of myself (critical in a self destructive way).

Some things were starting to look so bright until I had to make that stupid discovery regarding my past, I was dating a guy for approximately a half year and we established a great connection. However he is a university student and I am currently in an ‚ÄúMBO school‚Äù (just Google it if you don‚Äôt understand what it is) but it basically is a school you attend after high school/middle school and it‚Äôs a second option besides uni. 

But ever since I saw that my IQ was 68, I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be reasonable to date a guy that is attending university and supposedly happens to be an aspired lawyer, and a sales associate with an IQ of 68? That could never be compatible! We haven‚Äôt talked ever since this entire debacle and I feel really guilty, but if he only understood what I am going through during this abnormal time..

Can you imagine how this has affected my self esteem and the ability to rely on myself? Everything I do is questionable at this point, whether I‚Äôm writing something for my blog I feel like an imposter even though I do not even glance at other sites when I‚Äôm writing narratives, whenever I say something in a ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù way I assume it must be an coincidence or that someone is controlling my soul. In conclusion this is very frustrating because I have days where I come off as an ‚Äúsophisticated person‚Äù and then there are days where I seem to be a mentally challenged weirdo. I mean I wouldn‚Äôt mind if I was but at least I would like to know.

It feels like my mind is playing a game with me and it‚Äôs not amusing at all, my friends suspect that it might be depression or depersonalization since they doubt that I have any intellectual problems. But I doubt this since I always had complaints regarding my behavior and the fact that I don‚Äôt tend to solve problems appropriately in a working environment/ at internship so this has traumatized me as well.

This makes life seem like a simulation and not an actual authentic life, or perhaps the devil is fucking with my head who knows. But it makes my life extremely unbearable and it‚Äôs ruining my future and my relationships (specifically the romantic ones but also friendships) is there anyone who is experiencing anything that is even remotely comparable with my situation? Just let me know..

Some misc info: She drinks a lot and when she is drunk she gets really depressed, to the point of crying uncontrollably. I never seen this side of her. One thing for sure is that I won't drink with her again. The problems she are really way out of my area of comfortability and expertise. She has weight issues, self-esteem issues, and her parents are much of a help (I think her mom just says she needs to go to church).

328946,"How can I help a friend who is suicidalHiya,

I have a very good friend who has suicidal thoughts frequently.  She also recently self-harmed after about 5 years without doing so.  She has troubling thoughts about feeling useless and a bad person.  She is neither, but rather the kindest person I've met in many years, intelligent, caring, I could go on.  When she is happy she is such a joy to be around.


As for risk, she has access to enough medication as she is on painkillers for a medical condition.  She's not a planner, but rather I worry about her doing something impulsively.  I have caught her a couple of times when I've phoned her and she seems on the edge and has said that she didn't know what she'd have done if I hadn't 
intervened.


I am the only one who knows how bad things are.  She doesn't want me to say anything to others understandably but I'm worried as I do not live with her and whilst I do check on her and we're in very good contact on the internets, I cannot be sure she is ok all the time.  Family don't know, she lives with her parents and is 23.



I'm torn between telling someone else who could keep an eye on her and keeping her close to protect her.  I fear telling another would make her distance herself from me.


It‚Äôs complicated by the fact that we are romantically involved, though things are quite tenuous between us.  She has said that I'm the only thing she has to live for, and I do love her.  I have no problem being there for her, I‚Äôm utterly committed however she won‚Äôt commit to us because she says she doesn‚Äôt deserve me and worries about 
how much her issues are affecting me.  I'm stupid for getting involved I know, but I fell in love with her.


I know it‚Äôs not attention seeking, I have to pester her when she is feeling depressed before she'll admit it, even when it‚Äôs obvious.  When she‚Äôs like that it affects me so much, I worry.


She has tried seeking help, which made a small amount of progress, they suggested CBT.  That was before self-harming again, and they won‚Äôt help her now and are very slow at getting back with alternatives.  I'm clueless how to go about helping her find something.  She is aware that she needs help, though it was traumatic before and is reluctant now.

They're all so much more legitimate than my stupid, selfish feelings. I've had a fine life, I'm not that ugly, I have a couple friends, and I know enough to get decent grades.

But I hate myself. I constantly feel awful, I've tried dieting, exercising and I can never follow a routine. I try to be ambitious, but I can never keep it up. I've tried dating but they all run away from me before the month is up.

I feel depressed because I should have a normal life, I have just about everything, but *people* reject me, and I mean on a general level as well. I have every prerequisite to lead a happy life, and I can't because everyone around me snuffs out my happiness. My ideas are shot down because I'm me. I'm told my thinking is wrong because it doesn't match my ex's ideas.

I think the worst thing one of them told me was that my thinking was cyclical, but when I asked for help they wouldn't bother to help me break free. I tried killing myself the night before, they decided I had gone too far and dropped the next day. Now they and everyone else I know hates me for being so selfish.

And those are the people who even notice me.

You want to die when you try to sleep

You want to die when you work

You want to die when you exercise

You want to die when you shower

You want to die when you are on your phone


Sure, sometimes I get focused on the present and forget it about because I‚Äôm in the moment but obviously soon enough the though comes again.

I wonder every night if the next morning the thought would stop coming to me like magic but of course the very moment I wake up the thought pops into my head as if it was my daily ritual.

It‚Äôs not like the current situation is hard for me. The only thing that‚Äôs hard for me is that I can‚Äôt get my thoughts to come true. Either I have to get my thoughts into action or have my thoughts be gone. Tried twice already and it didn‚Äôt work. Wasn‚Äôt able to do it to myself. I don‚Äôt know if I was afraid of being suffocated for a several minutes. Maybe a gunshot would have been easier.

But with the country I am in, that‚Äôs not possible.

I‚Äôm sick of therapy. I‚Äôm sick of the same tests that I took for the last few years. I‚Äôm sick of talking to strangers that have to encounter me just because it‚Äôs their job.

Life is just boring. Used to like gaming, used to like technology. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt do those stuff anymore, but they don‚Äôt interest me anymore and the only reason I do them is because I‚Äôve done it before and those are the things that I know about. Current me is merely a remnant of the past.

Used to be very curious. Now nothing really intrigues me anymore. Miss my old past self but he‚Äôs gone now.

Ok well a little bit about me. I am a 21 year old ok looking Christian male in college. I am a really good guy (I think). I am the kind of guy that takes an hour and a half train to visit friends left and right. I go out of my way to hang out and keep friends company. Because of my upbringing, I am excepting of everyone I meet. I never judge you and will like you for who you are. I give up my time for my friends all the time. I think I sound like a good guy but I'm not sure.
I have had two girlfriends in the past and I have treated them well. I am always respectful of them. I never curse, never make dirty jokes or comments, and always give up what I am doing for them. Neither of them lived near me but close enough to take an hour and a half train ride (there and back) to go see them almost every other day. I have never been complemented by them other then I am a nice guy. I have never been called good looking.
Ok sorry for the long intro.

I have been really down lately. At first I didn't know why. I have friends, a family that loves me, I am in good standing at my college, I am in good health. Everything should be great. Well a few years ago I randomly took a personality test (I don't remember why) and the result I got was this, ""You are the kind of person everyone will like, but nobody will love."" I still remember that. I have been looking at my life lately and I have noticed a few things. That result is right. I am the guy everyone ikes but nobody loves. I give all my time for my friends and do so much for them, but I have never gotten anything back.  I have even helped many of them with problems and have been there as a shoulder to cry on. They have all told what a good friend I am and how much of a blessing it is to be their friend. Often times I catch myself in my room with nothing going on and when I go to see what my friends are doing I see that they got together to do some fun event or went out for no reason. I feel like I don't really have any real friends. Whenever we hang out they they seem like they really enjoy my company most of the time. But if that is so then why am I always left out?
I have treated my 2 girlfriends with nothing but love and respect. I have worked my life to fit theirs. I have been for them on their sad days, their worst days, and their best days. And yet I have never gotten a so much as ""Hey you should come visit"" or ""I like the way you look"". I have always been the one to initiate a visit and given the complements. I have always been a little low esteem about how I look and never thought I looked handsome. I was never sure if they liked how I looked. I ended up leaving them because both of them wanted to go to places I couldn't follow. I guess they didn't really see a future with me. Although, both girls have said I was everything they wanted in a guy but was that really true?
After looking through my past I feel like I am not a good guy like they all say. Sometimes I feel like I am selfish. I don't know why. But lately I have been thinking. I give so much of my life to people that I never get anything in return. I have never asked for something in return mind you. It's just that, isn't that what is supposed to happen when you give your life to others and not yourself? I feel so down. So tired. It has gotten worse this past week. I can't focus on school. I can't keep up a smile when I am with people.  Am also kind new to trying to find God. I know most of reddit are atheists and don't care about God but I know that there are some good people here and that they wouldn't let the God part affect them.
Recently I have thought it over and I don't know if I want to be here anymore. Really I just don't want to be me. Many thoughts about ending it all has crept up on me. I don't think I could ever kill myself, but I just don't want to be someone who means nothing to anybody. I don't know if I explained it right or if I just look like some guy who thinks he deserves better, but what I do know is that the pain is real and it is here.
Please. I don't really know who to talk to. I figured my best bet would be here. I'll be back one later. If anyone could just comfort me in anyway I would greatly appreciate it.

 Could feel toes, had muscle weakness.  Her pulse was , I guess, 110.  I could not find it well even though I've had training to take pulse.  Cut arm was very cold.  Other extremities were less so, but still colder than normal.

She's had some rough times and a friend that cut often.  Yesterday, her friend had cut and showed it to my sister.  My sister, I think, also had some anxiety and depression that she hid.  Decreased appetite and socializing weeks before this.  I've had some rough time too - almost cut/killed myself - but I never actually did it.  Holy shit

I don't know.  Just please, someone tell me what is happened.  She said she didn't drink anything, even though statistics say OD is a favorite among females.  Couldn't find the cutting device.

We would laugh together cry together, gobble up liters of ice cream and sweets, working around in his garden playing. And today he can't stand up without someone holding him he can't speak without choking on his own spit he can't eat without the food spilling all over him.

307100,"""That May Never Go Away""Psychiatry has a consensus for me. It's not about my diagnosis. Doctors continue to re-diagnose me and squabble about the inaccuracies of the previous care team. It's not about my treatment. I'm currently seeing a psychoanalyst, social worker, and forensic psychiatrist, and between the three conflicting viewpoints I can occasionally catch each provider in contempt for the other two. What's been consistent throughout my treatment, across providers, across hospitals, and across the past 10 years that I've been in treatment, is that I will never get better. 

The first time I heard this sentiment was around 13 years old. Only in the 7th grade, I was already sizing up my grades, standardized test scores, and extra-curriculars. I was also already diagnosed with something they called ""early onset rapid cycling bipolar disorder with psychosis"". This is highly contested as a medical condition, since anyone qualifying for the ""early-onset"" category is already so moody at that age as to account for the ""rapid cycling"" parameter. We were talking about mood swings that ranged from deeply suicidal to euphorically enlightening in a matter of minutes, with one mitigating factor: whether I was in my parent's care or anywhere else. The bipolar diagnosis didn't stick, but the advice the psychiatrist gave me when I shared my future hopes for college has. He said, don't get your hopes up about going to college or even working in the future. You won't be able to. You have a debilitating disorder that you will have, and you will require medication for, the rest of your life. 

My bullshit meter went up at that point. I was ALREADY in treatment and on medication, and at the same time, I was ALREADY earning honor roll in the most accelerated academic track my school district offered, on top of band and babysitting. Whereas his logic was, if you're already in treatment now then you will surely be ill in the future, mine was, if I'm already IN treatment now then what does it matter if I'm mentally ill in the future? Unfortunately, these types of questions are often met quite defensively by psychiatrists who promote an internally disintegrated field of medicine. In the late 2000s when I first started meds, childhood diagnoses were very new (and still are), and we still await the longitudinal outcomes from treating my generation so aggressively. But considering I've had doctors check their psychiatric almanacs just to prescribe zoloft, I have little reason to believe they measure their zeal by the state of the literature, or even keep it present in their minds. Even still, how many carry the hope that a child might be liberated from the suffering of their socially constructed marginalization (aka mental illness) through a cultural transformation, like so many of us queer kids who reached adulthood in the gay rights era? The most pointed ""what if"" may be the psychiatrist's apparent lack of faith in his own profession's ability to cure my disease. And with so many years ahead of me at 13. 

I learned quickly from that to not speak to psychiatrists about such things as college, or a future, or happiness. But over the past year the two have involuntarily knocked heads again, with a new, modified message. As I am already in college at one of the top ten public institutions in the country, and I have done so while suffering from the same aching, suicidal depression (now accompanied by PTSD and a related personality disorder), the tune has changed to something perhaps more foreboding. Now it's time to plan for a future in which the suicidal thoughts may never stop. And I've heard this from 4 different providers in the past year. 

There used to be days in the depression that weren't clouded with suicide. To get to suicidal thoughts I had to put a lot of effort into hating and undermining myself. Hating the world, as part of a judgmental personality, or finding a more directed avenue for it in politics, or finding a way to turn that skill into something that benefitted others in the form of social justice, were just quirky parts of my day that did not send me down the trash shoot to death thoughts. I could rally for a cause, or for the ones I loved, or for the delectable carrot stick of a good grade, to stand up more days than I laid down and in this balance I could keep going. 

I proved I could survive (now 22) and go to college. I proved I could wrestle a severe psychiatric diagnosis as just a little girl, and perhaps transcend it considering the prognosis at the time.  Now I tell them about how devastated I am to fight against the possibility of my death and they say, in unison, ""that may never go away"".

In high school I got involved in extracurriculars, earned a 4.2 gpa, volunteered and went to a really good school in a very difficult stem field. I changed majors to another STEM field and struggled a bit first but eventually started doing what I am suppose to do: getting internship experience, getting involved on hands on engineering clubs, getting a leadership position, and maintaining a decent GPA. Even getting all that was an uphill battle with all of its competition. 

Now I am back at home rotting away while my friends both in high school and college are doing well. It seems like anything less than a perfect performance on an interview means I won't make it to the next step. It sucks going through 4 interviews with the same company only to have some picture perfect candidate swoop in and take it. 3 months and I don't have anything solid. 

Yes even people who dropped out of college are doing well, because they either had the right people vouch for them, have excellent sales skills or just simply lived in the right location. Conventional wisdom says they won't become successful but it seems like I would've done better by simply working my way up or focusing on becoming one of the popular kids than doing the right thing.

The principal is this a joke to you, I said no it‚Äôs funny the way you say it. So he says it was a gateway for me to give him the game. And there thinking about my punishment, so far I have not got in iss or anything like that. This was before COVID so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm get anything coming to me any time soon.",non-suicide

40822,"Prepare to roll your eyes...I'm 23, was just dismissed from the University of Pittsburgh and just let go from my Student job. Thousands of dollars in student debt and behind months worth of rent. I see it plain as day, my life isn't over, I've been through worse. I'm just tired, I've failed so many times that it's getting difficult to summon any strength. Thankfully the more time I spend failing, the more doors close. Those stars I've been shooting for come closer to the ground every time I miss.

I attended the Swanson School of Engineering on a whim, and found myself in a depressing city with broken people. My relationships have been uninspired, my jobs all dead-end, and I can't help but realize that I'm the constant factor. I only have superficial interests, spend my days watching Youtube videos ad nauseam, I think the site preys on the bored and the depressed alike. I spend my days entertaining myself, and think that maybe my secret passion is entertaining others. I'm definitely critical, so maybe I can be a writer, director, or even a Youtuber.

Irresponsibly, I bought a condensor microphone and wrote a script, I wanted to make someone laugh. After a week of struggling to release my first 2-3 minute video, I've realized that anything I'm going to want to do will require hard work. I feel like I just don't have it in me, 5 years of misery has beaten all the joy out of my life. I kicked a 9 month spice/bath salts addiction years ago, but find that I'm still that weak piece of garbage waiting for the next source of entertainment.

I'd say I don't have any passions in life, but really, I don't have any passion for life. I feel like trying to continue with making videos, or really anything creative will help, but I can't express enough how it just feels like I'm moving through quicksand. Like there's some small voice within me begging me to keep going, but all I can muster are expressionless, labored movements.

If it weren't for the trouble it would cause my loved ones, I would have jumped off to the next life in seconds. I hope that by writing this embarrassing, whiny, drivel, I've at least shown that I'm authentically unhappy and more importantly I hope you forgive me for taking up your time.

Thank you for reading, I'd appreciate any feedback at all really.",suicide

35493,"Roses are red, I ate a bat, According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume.

That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you ng? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know?

What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends.

Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I t to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know,  to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Oan't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. , you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice. Right, right. Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going. I had to open my mouth and talk. Vanessa? Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going? To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena. They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it. Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this. I know. Me neither. Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports. Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? Roses! Vanessa! Roses?! Barry? - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are. Flowers, bees, pollen! I know. That's why this is the last parade. Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down? Oould you slow down? Barry! OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault. Yes, it kind of is. I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse. Actually, it's completely closed down. I thought maybe you were remodeling. But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined. I don't want to hear it! All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park. All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got. - Bees. - Park. - Pollen! - Flowers. - Repollination! - Across the nation! Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia. They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight. I have an idea. Vanessa Bloome, FTD. Official floral business. It's real. Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch. Thank you. It was a gift. Once inside, we just pick the right float. How about The Princess and the Pea? I could be the princess, and you could be the pea! Yes, I got it. - Where should I sit? - What are you? - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea? It goes under the mattresses. - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal. You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco! Let's see what this baby'll do. Hey, what are you doing?! Then all we do is blend in with traffic... ...without arousing suspicion. Once at the airport, there's no stopping us. Stop! Security. - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes. Has it been in your possession the entire time? Would you remove your shoes? - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job. Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job! I think this is gonna work. It's got to work. Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay. Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it. I gotta get up there and talk to them. Be careful. Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. Oaptain, I'm in a real situation. - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing. Bee! Don't freak out! My entire species... What are you doing? - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney? Don't move. Oh, Barry. Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry! What happened here? There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded. One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious! - Is that another bee joke? - No! No one's flying the plane! This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status? This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York. Where's the pilot? He's unconscious, and so is the copilot. Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is. - Who's that? - Barry Benson. From the honey trial?! Oh, great. Vanessa, this is nothing ."" - Get this on the air! - Got it. - Stand by. - We're going live. The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O. We get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow! - Hello! Left, right, down, hover. - Hover? - Forget hover. This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep! Barry, what happened?! Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time. - That may have been helping me. - And now we're not! So it turns out I cannot fly a plane. All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out! Move out! Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane! Don't have to yell. I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble. It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice! It's not a tone. I'm panicking! I can't do this! Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it! You snap out of it. You snap out of it. - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it's my turn. How is the plane flying? I don't know. Hello? Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? The Pollen Jocks! They do get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow. - Hello. All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop. Where? I can't see anything. Oan you? No, nothing. It's all cloudy. Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry. - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something. - What? - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me. Like a 27-million-year-old instinct. Bring the nose down. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! - Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK. Out the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys? Affirmative! Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it. Land on that flower! Ready? Full reverse! Spin it around! - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one? - That flower. - I'm aiming at the flower! That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees! Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up. Rotate around it. - This is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly. Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern? Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse! Just drop it. Be a part of it. Aim for the center! Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman! Oome on, already. Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly! - Yes. No high-five! - Right. Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower? What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius! - Thank you. - But we're not done yet. Listen, everyone! This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That means this is our last chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this. If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say? Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains? We're bees! Keychain! Then follow me! Except Keychain. Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this. Yeah! I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves. Oh, yeah. That's our Barry. Mom! The bees are back! If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight! Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who's next? Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these. Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel! Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat! I had no idea. Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment? Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you. Sorry I'm late. He's a lawyer too? I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase. Have a great afternoon! Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere. No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me. You're a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who's next? All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly. Thank you, Barry! That bee is living my life! Let it go, Kenny. - When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go. - Beautiful day to fly. - Sure is. Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office. You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. - Thinking bee! - Me? Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Oan we stop here? I'm not making a major life decision during a production number! All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.

Reminds me of a song

""One fine day Gonna leave you all behind It wouldn't be so bad If I had more time 

Sailing down a river alone I've been trying to find My way back home But I don't believe in magic Life is automatic But I don't mind being on my own No, I don't mind being on my own""

Nonexistence before birth was my home and I'll be coming home when I leave here. I don't believe in magic because that desire to live, that desire to become the best, that desire to be happy, it doesn't live within me. Life is automatic because I have no control over it and this escape is the one absolute choice I have and it can't be taken away, I won't let it.

And I really don't mind being on my own. I'm fine with it. Loneliness is not as bad as people make it out to be, in a sense I feel kind of...free.",suicide

210859,"Was it the right choice?Background: My country offers a mainstream high school program that leads directly to university and an alternative program that is supposed to lead straight into the workforce. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently doing the mainstream program, wanting to switch into the alternative program because of a lot of personal reasons that i don't want to go over. But basically im stuck in a loop where i get work but then think that its irrelevant and decide not to do it but then get stressed as the work piles up. 

&amp;#x200B;

To avoid this i've decided i want to switch into the alternative program. I've wanted to do this since last year, i spoke with my parents last year but they lectured me for hours and convinced me to stick with the mainstream program because its ""only a few more years"". 

&amp;#x200B;

So i tried, i did all the work i was set, i got decent to good grades (depending on the subject) for the first few months. But now all of the problems i had last year have hit again. I just feel the work is really mundane and that it won't help me in the future at all. Yeah, it is only a few years and yeah, if i successfully complete it then it'll all be good, but the only thing i see down that path for me is suicide. There's a lot of work that im not willing to do. And eventually it will get to a point where i try to kill myself, i mean i've already thought about doing it hundreds of times throughout the last few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

If i go with the alternative program, there is still a path to university, it'll take exactly the same time to reach university as if i had gone with the mainstream program and as far as i know its actually a guaranteed entry which the mainstream program doesn't have as if you get too low of a score for exams you might not be able to get into the course. 

&amp;#x200B;

It would take a lot more money though. I would say my families pretty well off and that they should be able to cover the cost easily. But i've learnt from reading reddit posts that parents can hide the fact that they do not have a lot of money extremely well. 

&amp;#x200B;

But anyway, the main thing is that im just getting a lot of doubt now. Like maybe i should do the mainstream program as it is a lot more simpler. Did i really choose the right choice?",suicide

I must be in hell, this is ridiculous, how can someone suffer so much? Then I feel ashamed of not being able to cope with first world problems, when there is so much more suffering in the world. Everyone has it worse. Stop being dramatic.

Everyone in my life dies or suffers, or doesn't care. I told my sister today that I wanted to hang myself, everything was too much, and she said something like, ""I'm really depressed too :("" and went on to talk about her own problems as usual... I definitely left room open for it to be a joke.. the suicide thing, I mean. So she probably didn't know. But she knows I'm depressed. I've told her I was depressed before. But it doesn't seem to reach her.

Doesn't reach my dad either. He gets uncomfortable if I'm upset, and finds a reason to hang up. So I stopped telling him I was. He has to talk about himself too, I don't think I've told him a single thing about myself in over a year now..

I only have one thing keeping me alive, trying to support my best friend. But finances are fucked up, so bad right now, the main trigger for this little episode of mine. Everything's a mess, and I might be out of a job soon because I'm a fuckup. I get panicky about paying rent, paying off bills I'm behind on. I'm not even good company. They would be better off if I died, right? Someone else can help them, I'm sure.. 

There's.. no one else that I talk to.

So stupid that money is the trigger for all of this. It's not even that, though.. if little things like this are enough for me to want to die, then what's the point of living? I'm never happy, and the world ends when I have financial problems. I can't accept it as just life, or just things everyone goes through. I'm too tired to deal with all of this. 

I've been thinking of ways to die. And it's frustrating because.. I don't want to die. I just want things to be better. And I know they can't be better if I'm dead. But they haven't been good for 30 years, so why even bother putting myself through this.

132098,"It's time to goSo, yeah, stumbled upon this subreddit and I wasn't really aware that such place exist. I'm not really familiar with the idea of this sub, and actually never had account on reddit, but since I have noone to confess to, I think I can possibly use this sub to vent out. 

I don't want to add any drama to this post, cause I am perfectly aware of the fact that noone will do anything more than write some useless cheer up post which in the end won't make any difference whatsoever, I guess you can't help in suicide thoughts using emergency help -&gt; these things will most likely strike back like uncureable disease. 

So, yeah. Standard, one-time conversation won't make much of a difference, but that's not why I'm here. 

I just received a package with 1g of sodium cyanide, ordered from the shop which is primarily supplying laboratories. It's quite easy to obtain cyanide salt in my country, basically there are no law restrictions, the only thing you have to do is supply some statement describing the declaration of use - made some shit up, they gave it a green light. 

So, the decision has been made, it's now only a matter of the timing and the actual method. So basically, I gave myself about a month, should be ok with cyanide salt which is in the tiny phial. 

Than the place, I've been studying medical documentations concerning acute cyanide poisoning in suicidal attempts, one thing I know for sure is that I have to make sure I won't mess this up, if I do, I will face inevitable medical consequences, the state called cyanide-induced parkinsonism, which is pretty much uncureable, the state which will last forever. 

Than the place, I'm thinking of some hotel, will likely opt to that. At least, someone will find my corpse, if I'd make it in my apartment knowing the fact that noone gives a shit whether I'm alive or not, noone would probably find me. 

I need at least 1,5 hours to make sure, I won't be rescued, that's said - accordingly to so many cases I found in documentation, it's the time needed for cyanide salts ingested to block enough amount of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase, so that it would lead to brain death - effectively saying, I'll be pronounced dead, even if my heart won't stop. 

Actually, I'm quite tired to write about my personal life, but I'm sure I will have occasion to treat this post like a kind of a last blog of pending suicide, so maybe will give an update, if anyone's bothered. ",suicide

Liberals are very sensitive and unreasonable people, they don't understand that people can come to different conclusions and have different viewpoints.

254188,"Finally opened up to my wife about my highschool bullying. It's destroying me and making me wonder why her, women and ppl in general even like me? I feel so hopeless and broken.I'm not handsome, talk rugged and tan. I'm an average guy 5'9, decent looking and I have a ok job and career.

I've recently began to open up about my highschool bullying and it's been messing with my self esteem a lot. These past traumas are haunting me daily and it's scaring me.

Yet, for my entire life I've been able to get very attractive girls to fall for me. When I look back, I the average bullied guy landed the 2 most desirable girls in highschool. In college I got babe after babe. And since then I met and married my wife who's also gorgeous. Not to mention my two best female friends have made moves on me too.

This sounds like a humble brag but if you knew how I felt you'd understand. The weird thing is that none of these women treated me like a quick ONS or FWB. They ALL fell in love with me. Almost all of them wanted a future with me. And yet all except my wife I broke up with them because I didn't feel it back. I wanted to sabotage the relationship with my wife too. The only reason I didn't was because she was a bit broken herself yet so confident and strong, I idolised her and I couldn't lose her.

Now Imagine being ridiculed relentlessly for years in highschool. Bullied and tormented to the point where suicide or murdering my bullies seemed like my only options.

I feel so shattered still, like I still have a point to prove. I have very little to no close friends yet I've got ppl who always seem like they wanna see me. My wife loves me and will do anything for me. She truly truly loves me. My two best female friends will sometimes drop anythitn to help me and will turn to me for help over anyone else. Both of whom said they'd be my gf if I wasn't married. My wife knows them well and she doesn't mind, she loves that they love me and has even said if I hooked up with them she wouldn't be mad. My wife has a polyamory type mindset where if there's a women she genuinely likes she feels no jealously if I find them attractive too..

But that's back to the point. Why do people love or even like me? My first boss a guy I ended up betraying would hire me back in an instant. My two other previous managers reach out every so often asking if I want to return to my former jobs. My new boss, sometimes despite me messing up will have my back always.

I don't get it, I don't make any effort or very little to reach out and be nice to people yet I seem to be more liked than most.

I'm not attractive, but yet here I am, a damaged 6/10 guy whos wife is 9.

I broke down last night and asked my wife and one of my female friends. What is it you like in me? Why me, I'm not fun, great looking, rich or suave.

My wife said, it's because of how smart and relatable I am. She said no other person she's ever met is able to listen to her and understand. And the truth is we can talk for hours and hours. but is that love? We also have a lot of sex and i ask her why? We've been together almost 10 years yet we have sex sometimes 10 times a week. Her reason is that, there's something I'll never see but I have a cute innocent like quality that makes her just want to jump my bones. But is that sexy or a good thing?

My female friend said I'm the only guy she feels safe with. She said not in a gay make friend sort of way, but like she can trust me. I've gotten that line all my life, ppl innately trust me and tell me their deepest secrets and thoughts.

Why? What do I do that makes me someone worth sharing a secret with.

Full disclaimer: my parents are NOT abusive in any way, shape, or form. They've been total champions for me and my siblings all our lives, and want only the best for us. Not once have they ever been neglectful, narcissistic, or spiteful. They are NOT the enemy here.

For years, I've been struggling with problems like depression, food addiction, and trouble with social interaction, partially due to Asperger Syndrome. My parents, therapists, doctors, and countless other professionals have given me the advice and tools I need to make changes, but I just never feel like doing it. It's gotten to the point where I'm completely dependent on my parents emotionally and financially.

This week, my parents have finally put their foot down. Since I'm not willing to make the changes I need to get better, they're going to force me to make changes. I'm currently visiting over the weekend, and they've made me be more physically active, like going on walks and bike rides, despite me being obese and terrified of bugs. We've also entertained the idea of me moving back in with my parents, and they made it clear that they aren't going to enable the self-destructive behavior I do in my apartment. They're going to have me go outside more, eat healthier, and participate in more family activities even if it's not my first choice.

The problem is NOT that my folks are trying to help me. My parents are not the bad guys. It's that every time these sort of pushes happen, I always want to mentally run away, whether through sleeping, being on the internet, or playing video games. Now that my parents are really pushing me, part of me wants to tune out reality for good. I know I don't have the gall to end my life; I've tried multiple times, and always back out because I'm too scared. I just feel like there's really nothing left to enjoy about real life anymore. No goals I look forward to reaching; no fun events or plans to get excited about (most of them were cancelled from the pandemic.) Whatever I DO enjoy I end up overdoing, like sugar and video games. Much of life is still very restricted due to the pandemic, and all my friends are either too busy or too far away to ever hang out with anymore. It's like I'm in a video game, and I've exhausted all the actions and dialogue. 

What should I do? Are my concerns legitimate, or do I just need to get over myself?

TL;DR: I'm stuck in bad habits, and my parents are going to force me to make changes while I'm visiting, and eventually, live with them. Instead of thinking these changes will help me, part of me wishes I were dead so I could avoid reality forever. These are just thoughts; no plans to actually end my life.",suicide

****

I think self-love is born when we know we are loved by others (family members/friends/significant other), and we know that we're important because of it, and the love we feel for others also helps them build themselves and so on, pretty much creating a cycle of getting love and giving it as well.

I used to love myself once, and I still remember how it felt like. 

I remember that I used to believe in myself, that I had ambition, that I didn't really care about the outside world and so on.

After I was 16, I slowly stopped loving myself, because of bad decisions I made as well as mistakes, being rejected, bullied a lot, ignored... 
The final nail in the coffin was that almost every single decision I made was wrong, and it ended with consequences, even when I didn't have any bad intention...

Add the fact that everything was going downhill, and it pretty much tore apart almost all of the self love I had left.

How could I love myself, when almost everything I believed in, everything I thought was right, everything I ever fought for, turned out wrong?

****

Note: the words I'm going to say only are meant to describe my situation, I don't want to offend anyone who is enduring something similar or worse, I give my word on that.

****

Most of the efforts I used to change my situation only made things even worse...

I'm sure some people see me as a special needs person and/or with pity at best, or a retard at worst because of a mistake I made, almost no one texts me, when I'm not talking with the few friends I have left my What's App is either filled with college work/projects or plain silent.

Sadly, society is like this. Most of the time abusers get scot free, while those they hurt have to pay the price.

Therapy, pills, improving everything they are, having to analyze themselves time after time because they don't know why life is like this and so on...

I've always analyzed myself, tried to change as much as I could, I tried to use the beliefs I've had since childhood, but in the end they were wrong, or rather, I was wrong.

This is the reason I want to die, because I can't do this on my own...

I can't create love out of nothing, I can't love myself knowing the mistakes I made, the stained legacy I've had in the past years...

A legacy of broken friendships, regrets, being hated and ignored, and so on...

Humans are social creatures, and because of that, it wouldn't matter if I learned to love myself again, since I would still be mostly alone... 

And loneliness is one of the worst kinds of mental pain, because you know that you don't matter to many people, that you care about people who either stopped caring about you, or they never did in the first place...

I admit it, I'm broken. My psychologist gave me some tasks and I haven't done them because I lack that motivation, I feel like there's pretty much nothing out there for me, that I dug my own grave with my mistakes, and there's no going back...",suicide
126395,"No treatment for depression or ocd can change real factsThis is basically a copy paste from my post in r/ocd.  The stupid thing has ruined my life, it's taken away the one chance I had to live a good life, everything I love, it's unfair, and I think if the world is a jerk to you and hands you an awful life and an awful brain, I am allowed to say I've had enough, I don't accept this as my life, screw it, I'm out.

I'm staying alive only because I should at least give the med I will be going on a fair chance, but it won't work, not even an MAOI worked, medications don't change facts, I know it with almost absolute certainty.

So a few months ago I was having intrusive thoughts, terrible ones about how others are suffering right now and I'm not doing anything to help them and I was worried about it.  A friend sent me a Ted talk from Peter Singer about how I can help the most amount of people by donating to the most effective charities where a small amount of money can go to help the most people.  $2 can give a family in Africa a net to protect against malaria.  Some of the other charities supported by him show that for every $1 you could give almost 2 people vitamin fortification for their food for a year and malnutrition is still a leading cause of death. 

Now every single time I buy something for myself, I am aware of the cost.  Every $2 I spend on myself, I am choosing to spend that money on some minor thing that probably doesn't matter, rather than giving a family in Africa a net to protect them from malaria.  Even $1 could provide fortification to food for someone for an entire year.  And here I am, spending it on a snack in a vending machine, for a single human in a 1st world country, for a single fleeting moment of getting to have a snack.  It's not ""what if"" I am a bad person.  It's I am a bad person.  The fact that I know suffering is happening and I'm not doing as much as I could to stop it makes me a bad person.  I'm a medical student, I'm helping a few patients every day, but I'm not also donating to charities or to homeless people who need my money more than me when I have a few thousand dollars in my bank that would go so much farther spent on someone else than on some minor luxury for me.

It is not an uncertainty that I am a bad person or not, it is a TRUE FACT that someone else in the world is being denied malaria nets/nutrition for an entire year because I decided yesterday to spend $3 on myself for lunch instead of donating to them.  I am, through my inaction, causing others to suffer.  One person suffering minor inconvenience by giving up small unnecessary things is nothing to thousands who aren't being helped because I still have money sitting in my bank.  I could legitimately be helping more people and I am legitimately not.  It's a true fact and I can't live with myself knowing this anymore.  Every time I buy even food for myself, I think of Feeding America, where $1 donated could provide 10 meals.  It's not ""what if I am a bad person"" it's ""by buying this extra little snack for myself for $1 and not donating it, I am choosing to not give 10 people a meal, I am valuing a snack for myself over the happiness of 10 people, that's the kind of person I am that I put the value of a minor purchase for myself that won't matter in the future over something that can genuinely help others.""

I can't buy anything anymore, I can't do anything fun or enjoyable anymore, it all costs something, it all costs time, time and money that could be helping so much more people than it is now when I just sit here.  I wasn't able to enjoy Thanksgiving because gratitude only triggers guilt in me when I'm reminded of the things in life that I have that others don't.  Despite donating $50 to Feeding America to be equal to the cost of our family's meal, I felt nothing but guilt.  Not even remote happiness that at least others would have food.  I felt awful every single bite of food that I ate because there are still people who don't have food.  I can't eat without feeling guilt over what I'm not giving to others.  My mom got me a Nintendo switch for my birthday and I felt utterly awful because that money could have given hundreds of people meals or nutrition and it was wasted on one human.

I just want my life back, but to tell the thought that it's just a thought and it's ocd is to tell myself that I'm okay with others suffering.  To recover from the thoughts so that they don't bother me is to make it so knowing that others are suffering doesn't bother me, and that idea is something so horrible and disturbing that I'm not willing to live with it.  It's a constant awareness of actual facts, an awareness that if I were to feel less, I'd be more selfish and still know deep down that I'm a bad person.  I try to meditate and allow the thoughts to be there, I've tried to allow the possibility that the thoughts are true and sit with them, but nothing helps.  I've tried SSRIs, abilify, phenelzine, TMS both for depression and ocd, memantine, medical marijuana, countless random supplements, and ketamine (spravato), none have helped.  I've been in therapy for years which hasn't helped at all, and I've been stuck in the same place for the last 2 months with my therapist with no progress or change.  The only thing that slightly helped in the past was clomipramine but it had a lot of side effects so I had been off it, and the ocd was a different type of ocd which was just me and my own intrusive thoughts.  I've had other variants of ocd for which ERP over 17 weeks had no effect on and made worse.  I sit there with the thoughts.  I went a month without donating money, trying to just live my own life.  I try not to ruminate, but the ruminations are just as automatic and intrusive as any other thought, not able to be controlled or stopped.  It. Does. Not. Go. Away.  The knowing I'm not helping others doesn't go away.  It's every second of the day as soon as I wake up to the moment I sleep on the bed that I didn't earn in the apartment that I'm paying 500 malaria nets a month to live in.  I got such bad grades in med school due to ocd interrupting everything and making me anxious and unable to study that I didn't even apply for a residency, I absolutely hated the actual job part of medicine, I hated pretty much every rotation, I hate the idea of making decisions with uncertainty and potentially killing someone, and now all I can think is I should have applied because then I would have been able to make more money to donate to others but now I'm horrible because I didn't do that.

No matter what I do, I could always be doing more for others and I'm not.  It's not a what if, it's a fact that will never change, it's a fact that no matter what I do, someone else will lose something because of me.  Every dollar I spend on myself is a dollar that could have given someone vitamin fortification in their food for a year.  I'll never be able to go to a concert, buy a video game, take a trip, eat out, do something for fun without being aware of it and feeling guilty.  It's been true for every pleasurable experience I've had over the past 2 months.  And I can't use the argument that it makes me happy to do things for myself so I can help others in the future because my small amount of happiness is costing someone else so much more that I could have given to them, and I don't even feel any happiness, only guilt, so doing anything for myself literally doesn't even benefit me at all, it only takes from someone else.  Every single moment of my life is ruined by it.  I will never be able to know peace knowing others are suffering.  I haven't felt peace once since it developed to this severity 3 years ago.  This will never change.  In about a month I'll be able to start on clomipramine again after weaning off phenelzine (which had literally no effect on OCD or depression for me, it's only gotten worse).  It's my last hope.  But this time not even clomipramine will work.  No medication or therapy will be able to change what's true and the fact that I'm now aware of it and I can never be unaware.  I never asked for this, it's unfair, I'm so ticked off that the one life I get has to be ruined for the rest of it because of this stupid mental disorder that 98% of people don't have to have.  Once I've been on a few months of clomipramine to know it doesn't work and that nothing will, I'm done.",suicide

At this point i'm basically just waiting to get triggered again to then be able to do it, which shouldn't take too long considering how many things trigger me.

I'm still far from stable, although not acutely in danger even without tranquilizer at the moment, and would like to know if any of you have tips for dealing with the regrets / feelings after almost having gone through with it.",suicide
270790,"I don't think I want to die but I definitely don't want to liveIt wasn't that long ago that I was a motivated person with goals and values. I naively wanted to make the world a better place and to make myself worthy of the respect that I felt towards those that do make a difference. I even achieved some success getting my Master's degree and then a decent advocacy job. I wasn't happy but I could convince myself to keep going in pursuit of some kind of greener pasture.

In the last 2 years or so, I realized there is no greener pasture. I don't really care about money outside of basic financial security. I've never had a friend or girlfriend that didn't disappoint me (not that I didn't justifiably disappoint a few of them) which makes me see no point in socializing. 

The one thing I'm passionate about, politics, has deteriorated completely and I find myself hating the people I used to be allied. I've put a lot of thought into our current state of politics and thoroughly came to the conclusion that there's no hope for things to improve in this regard anytime soon. Most of the political/advocacy jobs I would have applied for in the past would now require my to compromise my ideals. As a result, I've been stuck working in marketing for the last 2 years and while I do have the skills, I hate it. It's starting to show and I know I can't continue there this depressed and unmotivated for much longer. I've been interviewing for other jobs for months now but I think the depression just emanates off me. I doubt they would be any better anyway.

I'm not a naturally sad or defeatist person and I've always been resilient about not letting little things get to me. But now that my sense of self is gone and after roughly 2 years of nothing good happening, those little things feel so much bigger. Just waking up and going to work is the most painful chore I could imagine. That in turn makes me feel lazy and thus hate myself even more. I keep trying to distract myself with my simple joys like weed/beer, exercise and watching sports but the effect is wearing off and my state of numbness is perpetual now.

It's pointless to talk to anyone because, even if they do care, all they'll give me is facile advice and treat me like a crazy person that needs to be handled delicately. I certainly can't talk to anyone whose respect I value because I would lose it immediately. My parents are selfish cunts and the thought of having to move in with them because I can't get or keep a job definitely makes suicide very appealing.

I live paycheck-to-paycheck because of my ridiculous Atlanta rent and student loan debt. My next paycheck comes on Monday. I've said this to myself before and didn't follow through but I really think I'm ready to buy a gun and get this over with. The thought of being forever a failure does make me a bit sad but generally I see suicide very positively. I really don't think there's anything to look forward to and I don't think I'm depriving the world of any future positive contributions. I don't care how my parents react and my friends will forget me pretty quickly. I could probably go on being numb and distracted if life were easy and I had financial security but the minimal satisfaction I get from smoking a joint, watching the Red Sox, etc. isn't worth the painful chore of living in this world.",suicide

134095,"I need to end this.I just can't take life anymore. I'm sick of constantly thinking about blowing my brains out, hanging myself, slicing my wrists, etc. I'm 25 years old today, and I really hope this is my last birthday, because I'm tired of feeling this way year after year. I've had clinical depression for as long as I can remember and it's made my life a living hell. I've never fit in well with others, I don't have any friends to call on for support, and since my ex broke up with me back in August, I've been feeling hollow as ever. The only reason I haven't ended it yet is because I know it would destroy my parents, especially now that my grandmother recently passed and my father hasn't been quite the same since. I seriously wish I'd get hit by a car, or shot, or just killed one way or another without having to commit suicide. I don't care if it's painful or agonizing, as long as the end result is my body going cold. 

I've been trying to put myself out there and a while back I did meet a girl and I fell in love with her, but of course she didn't feel the same way. We had everything in common but for some reason she just didn't share the same feelings and suggested we just stay friends. I couldnt say no, so now she snapchats me on a regular basis, always looking happy, always with friends, while I'm constantly alone and just wishing against all logic that she'll give me a chance at some point, even though she won't. What annoys me most though is this isn't even her fault. It's mine. I'm so fucking desperate to have someone in my life that I fall for girls after talking to them for a day or two and it always ends this way. But I can't help it. I always think the end result will be a good one, but it never is. 

I just hate this constant feeling of sorrow. I've tried to be happy, ive tried to treat my depression through distracting myself with art, exercise, puzzles, games, all kinds of dumb shit, but it never works for long, if at all. so here I am now, seriously considering taking my life. I bought my first handgun when I was 21 just for this very reason. I thought for sure I was gonna end it right after I bought it. I can't believe Im still here 4 years later. I don't want to do this, but I feel that I need to. Life's not gonna get any easier, it's not gonna get better.  I feel horrible for what this is gonna do to my parents, but their time will come, theyll grow old and die, and then none of this will matter anyway. I fucking hate myself. I really genuinely fucking hate myself. Millions of others have struggles far worse than mine and they fight on regardless of how they feel. I wasn't meant for this world, but then again, I never really asked to be here. If anyone can help me, if anyone has the slightest idea of a way to fix my mind, please help.

I've always have been single, due to the fact that I'm a fat ugly pathetic loser. I can't talk to people online because they lose interest quickly. An old friend told me to try tinder. Every match I got was either them trying to fuck with me, I would say hi and they don't respond, or they would unmatch me because, well I'm not sure. They always send a message then unmatch me but I can't see the conversation anymore after that. All I want is to have someone to love and care for. So I don't feel lonley. So I'm not bored with life. So I can have someone to spoil and make her smile. Someone to make me happy. But it's never going to happen. I accept the fact that I'm going to die alone but at the same time I keep beating myself up over it. I've tried to talk to hotlines through text, they all refer me to some online shit.

108955,"I feel so disappointed and humiliated. I just want it all to end.I share an apartment with Liar *not his real name* for 2 years now. I was in a relationship with him, and when that didn't go right, I looked as him as my best friend. He was the closest person I had, and I felt like I always had someone to lean on.... domestic partnership, as you would. I invested a lot in him, giving him cheap accommodation.... who turned out to be screwing another girl in our house while I was in  hospital.

We were in a relationship, there were ups and there were downs, but generally, I was happy. He never hit me. He's never tried to steal my money. He's never really done anything except genuinely care for me during my emotional meltdowns. When we broke up, I was interested in getting better emotionally, and hopefully, one day, get back with him in the future.

As for the living arrangements, I paid 2/3 of rent, all the internet bills and electricity bills. I work hard to buy him expensive alcohol and gifts, things to spoil him. He did pay $100 for rent, and bought dinners while I bought lunch. Every other month, I'd take him shopping for clothes. I took good care of the people who took care of me. When we broke up, I was having a depressive episode, so I went back into hospital.

The living arrangements led me to paying that much more than him since I had very specific house rules... I do not like girls in the house, he is not to bring home any girls (ESPECIALLY SAID GIRL, let's call her B) and he is not to throw parties in the apartment to be considerate for our neighbours.

After we've broken up, I have never increased his rent, and he's continued to reassure me that he's never broken the house rules, that no girls were over, and that I am safe (I needed this rule to feel that my house was in control and safe). I trusted him with this. After my discharge from my one-month-long stay in hospital, I went back to my country of origin in South East Asia for a month. I came back in January for 3 weeks to work (for school fees, bills, rent) and I left again in February.

We still talked like normal, he'd still ask me for nudes, he'd still tell me I was the prettiest/sexiest. I thought it was going well, me taking a break for a year and finding myself once more, while he could enjoy being free from my emotional burden.

I flew back early to XXX from south east asia because during my time there, Liar expressed he wanted a new phone as his friends had damaged his. So I went out of my way, helped him buy a phone for a lower price, and spent hours unlocking the phone. I did this all willingly because I thought he was taking good care of our apartment, and I genuinely care about him.

I came home midnight on 21st, and to my horror, B (girl 100% banned from my apartment) was in the lounge room watching tv. Liar was stunned, and I was too shocked and hurt for words. Liar drove B home instantly, but came downstairs where I was cooling off to 'stall', presumably so B can pack her things. Liar assured this was a one time thing. He assured that they were not having sex, and they especially assured they were not dating. He said B has only been in the apartment 3 times, which I affirmed it was still 3 times too many.

Next morning I found yellow underwear on the floor and a black top. I decided to find out for myself.. so I went through his facebook- which was where I fucked up. It turns out Liar was living with me because there were ""no good options"" to move out.. Other quotes like ""Good news! She's working 7 days a week now so you can come over."" and ""I found out she's leaving on the 22nd.. wanna come over?""

I feel so used. I feel so stupid. I feel so disgusted. I feel so worthless. I overdosed on my tranquillisers yesterday but they sent me home today after observation. I thought this was the guy that wouldn't screw me over... I had so much trust in him. I trusted him with my money, my house, my emotional state... my life. And he did this to me. I've messaged B with screen shots of what he's said to me... and confessed that we've had unsafe sex while I was in hospital in hopes that she would get herself checked... and see for herself that he isn't being loyal with her... only to be labelled as a psycho.

I'm so sorry for the rant... but I can't get it out of my head and I feel like I'm going to down another bottle with alcohol soon. I'm so sorry for ranting.. I'm so sorry I wrote so much people probably don't even give a shit...

10744,"Critical - Help for victims of emotional/mental abuse?Every day I fantasize about ending my own life. I feel the daily pain, the deep ache that never subsides and I ask when it will end. People always told me it would get better - that it gets better... But it never does... It never has and I've struggled with this torture for almost half of my life.

Big surprise - I am in a relationship that is mental and emotional torture. It is what's driving me the most to want to end it all, because we are trauma bound and there is no way out without feeling like I am tearing my skin off with it. I have no friends because this relationship has isolated me, I can't afford therapy, and I am from a broken home where no one in my family speaks or is close enough to me to trust to help.

I see help everywhere for rape/sexual abuse victims, people in dangerous situations - but where is the help for us in emotional and mental abuse situations? Am I doomed to this until I finally cut the life line and end it all?",suicide

I am a frequent relapsing self harmer and I can feel myself progressively falling deeper and deeper. I am afraid one day something is going to click and I will eventually end my life.

On the outside I'm pretty alright and I have days where I wonder how I could think such sark thoughts. I'm 24, I have a full time job that's decent and supplies wonderful health insurance. I am dating a childhood friend that I can see myself loving for the rest of my life, I've had things I have always wanted and although its tight-ish money wise due to rent that's going to be changing. But some how, deep down I hate myself and every little bump gets me so agitated and just ready to call it a day. My wonderful boyfriend is rather lazy and unless I manage him to do things around the house he doesn't bother. In that same aspect I have no motivation to do these things myself either. I'm overweight and have joined a gym and started eating better but in a few months I have seen little progress so I am feeling disgusted with myself on top of all this inner turmoil.

Just today, I'm off work because I'm sick and went out to get my prescription filled and swung by my boyfriends bank to pay his car payment (he doesn't have checks so he gives me cash to go into the bank. I do it cause I work afternoon shift and he works daylight. Bank is closed before he gets home) and we also had to pay a bill which was payable at a couple local banks. He left me money to do so because I talked to him about how me managing and paying all our bills has been wearing me out. I still feel upset that I still have to do the actual leg work, the whole point of the talk was to get him to take some of this responsibility but I would feel awful bringing it up cause he was in fact paying for the bill. Well on top of being irritated, sick, worried my boss might see me out and about after calling off, I get to the bank that is said on the bill was a location I could pay at and turns out they no longer do payments there. Pissed I call my boyfriend to vent a bit and he just doesn't help at all. I'm already sick and exhausted and now even more pissed and now am fighting off urges and disgust from just this little bump in a normal day. I ended up back tracking and going to one of the other banks listed and they still took payments and I got home and am resting but now that I'm alone on the couch this despair and anger is just overwhelming anything I feel. 

This is just one example of things that happen atleast weekly that break me a little more and more.

I just want to talk to someone that will actually help. I try to talk to my boyfriend but he isn't feeling well either and the conversation always turns back into how sick or how bored or how mad he is at work. For your nice I would like to feel as if I am important and what I feel matters.

First off, thank you for reading this. 

I am considering suicide. I have had medication (still on fluoxetine to this day) and have had intensive therapy from my teens up until I graduated university. I have had depression since about 11 years old and it's been like my shadow since.

I am so disillusioned. I worked my ass off in university, got stellar grades, and then tried teaching. It wasn't for me so mid-twenties, I decide to do a career change. I've always liked business and had an interest in accounting, so I did everything I could to get my foot in the door. I studied while working full time, got lucky and found a guy that would let me work for his business as a bookkeeper. I've since moved on to a junior accounting role with a big company, but I find I am terribly limited in my career. Why? No formal accounting training. I can't move up if I don't go back to school and get a degree. 

I am so discouraged because I work very hard - probably too hard - and want to do my best. I've been looked down by all my coworkers due to my lack of training. I can't get a raise or move upwards. I want to go back to school so much, but I am terrified of student loans. I did try taking classes PT while working FT, and I had to drop out of one and I'm failing my current one because I work so much. I just can barely study at night before I feel my eyes closing. I don't have a life and this hard work along with failing at my college courses is making me want to give up.

I just don't know what else to do, because life is so meaningless and I have always struggled with depression, and why struggle anymore? Why not just get off the hamster wheel that we call life, and end it all? I mean how is that worse than going into horrible student debt and then possibly not being able to pay it off? I've tried taking classes part time and working full time and I can't do it. I wish I could but I don't have the energy for it.  

I like aspects of living, like reading fiction, listening to music, spending time with my loved ones, dogs, animals.... but damn my life is 95% work and school. If life is simply struggling all the time, for years, then I think it is better to lose out on the good so I can end the bad.

And then I had to leave behind all my friends and move to a new state and start again without help.

And then I stopped caring, Its almost as if I lost the ability to feel and I want to Try to end it all to see if I can feel anything at all.

39059,"A thank you to my ex I know you use Reddit, and I doubt you‚Äôll see this but I had to get this off my chest. 
I hated myself while we dated. I hated the things I said, I hated how often I went against my moral values for you, and I hated how I changed my entire personality for you and your happiness. It still wasn‚Äôt enough, though. You still decided to write cruel comments about me, you still decided to hurt me indirectly, you still decided to tell me that you wished I had killed myself instead of living.

Well guess what? I‚Äôm still very much alive. You guilted me into self harming, you still give me frequent panic attacks, you‚Äôre the reason I have to bring anxiety medication to my job, where I have to see you. You made everything infinitely worse for me during that time, and I hated myself for everything. I knew everything wasn‚Äôt right and I stayed because I needed you. 

Despite all of that, I still have to thank you. I harbor a lot of resentment against you, but in the end you did help me realize a ton of things:
1. My happiness should not be destroyed for someone else‚Äôs. 
2. It‚Äôs okay to be myself, and to not change myself into who you are.
3. It‚Äôs okay to be depressed. It‚Äôs okay to have anxiety and feel like crap, it‚Äôs okay to be sad.
4. I‚Äôm not worthless, and I deserve someone who doesn‚Äôt treat me like I am such.
5. Having disagreements does not mean that the other person shouts at you until you cry.

I have to thank you because you introduced me to my current boyfriend, who I am soon celebrating 4 months with. He is my angel, my sunshine. I care for him and he cares for me. I am only sixteen, and I feel like I‚Äôve found someone I genuinely want to be with for the rest of my life. He is an amazing person; he listens to me when I‚Äôm sad (which to be frank isn‚Äôt nearly as often as it was when you were around), he listens to what I want and respects my boundaries instead of pushing me until I say yes. You accidentally introduced me to the most amazing person in my life, all because you just wanted to show me this random meme. 

I could hate you, but I don‚Äôt. The only thing I feel towards you is fear, and anxiety. You scare me, and I feel so afraid you will hurt me again. I‚Äôm not going to deny that I hurt you too through my sadness. However, you took it a step further by telling me, a person who has attempted suicide twice, that you wished I had killed myself.

I've become a bitter person, twisted by anger and resentment. It would be kinder for me to die than continue living in pain. I'm homeless and I live in a bad part of town, living paycheck to paycheck just to eat and stay alive. I didn't have the energy to go to work today because I was triggered by my brother texting me. I was abused by both my parents and an older brother. The family didn't care or believe me and discarded me the first chance they got. They only want me back to abuse me again. None of my ""friends"" know the truth and I'm alone. My first name gives me pain because it reminds me of being in that world again. I wake up with nightmares and an aching head or I'm just numb, consumed with self-loathing. I can't buy alcohol because I lost my ID, but I self-harmed this week and sometimes it's the only relief I get. I'm completely alone. I know so many people have been through worse and recovered or are still going but I'm just week. I've lost all opportunities to build a life. All I wanted to do was live in relative safety with a pet, but there are men shouting outside my door, staring at me in the street. I've been sexually assaulted and a victim of crime. I didn't say anything and remain trapped in my head. Every time I believe my life will get better because I'm further away from ""home"" it gets worse. I'm a broken child, who can't survive here and rather get raped or die with meth addicts and tweakers or whatever in the street I'd rather just end life on my own terms. No one will miss me because no one will care. I can't remember my story, so I can't articulate it to others so I suffer in silence. I tried to take anti-depressants but it just made me more angry and numb. I was forced on drugs so they could cover up what they did. They called me ""crazy"" and screamed at me every night.

I‚Äôve always been walked over because I‚Äôm quiet and nice, and I‚Äôve been bullied since I was 12. My parents are both dissociative and never asked me about my feelings, my day, etc. They use everything I say against me and have to argue with me on everything I say, I can never be right. We barely even talk anymore but I live in their house. I have a boyfriend who I love with everything I have but I‚Äôm so fucking sad that he‚Äôs distancing himself from me also and it seems like it‚Äôs almost the end of us. My birthday was two weeks ago and my only 2 friends cancelled their plans with me on the night we were supposed to celebrate. They said they‚Äôd reschedule but never brought it up again and I spent my birthday crying, again. 

Last year, when I turned 16, I tried throwing a party (didn‚Äôt even bother this year) I had about 20 people say they‚Äôd come, only 3 people showed up, 2 of them left early, and the last one stole my dad‚Äôs phone and moved to Pennsylvania the next day so there was no way to get it back. I have no one to even talk to about my feelings because my boyfriend basically tells me to get over myself and stop ruining his day and try to think of ‚Äúhappy things.‚Äù I have been suffering for so long that there‚Äôs no trace of happiness in my mind anymore. No one likes me, I see a therapist and it doesn‚Äôt even help, and I go to the most poor, miserable school ever where I don‚Äôt fit in anywhere, 

I just want happiness at this point, enough to get me through each day without crying or breaking down but I‚Äôm so weak and beat down that I feel like I can‚Äôt go on anymore. The only way I can end this suffering is to end it, I‚Äôve tried it multiple times before and didn‚Äôt die and I‚Äôm not scared to do it again. I just want someone to care enough to listen to me and try to help genuinely without just brushing it off because my depression puts them in a bad mood.

282081,"Got a crave on for the graveAfter so much irreversible damage and so many disappointments, I have come around to a new understanding of life. Life is not meant to be happy. 

Whatever happiness we may experience, in youth, or at  other times, is a passing fancy. Even the happiness of the most happy person eventually comes to ruin in old age. But by then death is nigh, for others like myself however, it is nowhere near nigh enough. 

I am almost 30 and daunted by the fact that there is still so much suffering left for me. I still have so many years and tears to look forward to.

The only reason I am alive at this point is to secure the futures of my children. But all the same, I dream of my day of death with eagerness. 

God knows how I feel, He and I both know my unhappiness is my own fault. I do deserve to suffer, and I accept that gracefully. In fact, it is my honor to suffer. I would rather suffer my sentence in this life and have a clean slate for the next. I'm not foolish enough to think that I, or anyone, is exempt from the laws of nature and spiritual justice. 

It's funny how so much pain causes you to not fear death. In being so depressed and suicidal all the time, I have actually become a very brave person. I am almost recklessly courageous, and I try to use that for righteousness, but it is only because I have nothing to lose. The world i so fucked it perceives good as evil, so you do end up being martyred and rejected, all because you follow the archetype of Jesus Christ by telling the  truth to people who love a  lie. 

I wonder if the devil tempting Jesus to jump 700 feet is anything like what I am going through. The bible says that it crossed the mind of Christ himself to jump off of a cliff. And that it was a temptation. 

I pray for death to come constantly but I know God won't let me rest or wimp out yet. The mind is a powerful thing and I know that my body will eventually give out just from me mentally not wanting to sustain it any more after a certain point. The will to live is key and without it you will wither away faster than if you cherish life and your flesh. 

I know God will eventually be merciful to me and let me die.

294372,"Methods and resources to help deal with thoughts of suicide that don't require therapists and medication?Hi /r/suicidewatch,

I have been struggling on and off with suicidal thoughts for almost a decade now. The only thing that's holding me back from killing myself is my family. My family has been very good to me and I love them very much. Regardless I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts due to other factors in my life.

I really want to get help so that I won't cause any grief to my family. I've tried therapists but they don't really help much. Some of them actually make me feel even worse afterwards. I also don't like speaking out loud about my feelings, especially to strangers like therapists, who otherwise wouldn't give a shit about me if it wasn't for the job they had to do. My oral communication skills aren't that great. I'm not very articulate and I always trip over my words, so I end up sounding dumber than I actually am. Also, I hate the fact that some therapists will automatically label a person as ""crazy"" before you even have a chance to speak about your problems. I'm just a normal person who just has a shitty problem, and so I want to be treated as a normal person.

Another reason for being wary of seeking this kind of help is the stigma that comes with things like this, and the fact that this kind of history of suicidal tendencies and visits to therapists can be used against me (i.e. for work, relationships, etc.)

Does anyone know of any coping mechanisms or other alternative methods that can help me? Most resources for suicidal people are for emergencies, or are short-term and are not anonymous. I rather that my friends and family not know about my problem. I want to be able to guide myself out of this (mostly) on my own like an adult.

If you need more background, I am currently in my 4th year in university, with two majors: one in the STEM field and one in the arts. But the job market is shit and I will probably end up working minimum wage for the rest of my life, which will be a huge disappointment for family, friends, and everyone else who knows me. So the horrible outlook for my studies/career is very demotivating. In terms of hobbies, I make art. Art is also completely useless and doesn't contribute anything to society so that's also demotivating factor. It just takes up space in my room and it drains whatever money I make, so there's no point in doing it. 

In addition to the uncertainty in my future in terms of work, finances, etc. another factor that contributed to my depression was the constant bullying and harassment I received in school from the age of 4 until my first year of university. I developed some self-image issues and social anxiety because of this, so it's difficult for me to trust people and make friends face-to-face, which makes things even worse.

I know that many more people have worse problems that they are dealing with and have better reasons for killing themselves. I'm sorry that there are other people in this world that have to suffer through worse things. 

I simply don't want to live anymore just because I don't feel like it. I just don't like life. I don't like the fact that I was forced into being alive. I don't like the fact that I have to stay alive no matter what. I wish life was optional. And I wish that my life and death wouldn't have an effect on loved ones.",suicide
311827,"Help meIve been suicidal for about 10 years, whilst i have been able to distract myself with jobs short term relationships ect the feelings are always there.

Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see.

Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls.

I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them.

I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police.

Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge.

My own diagnosis:
I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents.
I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. 
Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team.

The help im looking for:
I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from... Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things.

Thanks for reading and any support given.
Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

20438,"So, I'm 17 and I want to kill myself. Pretty standard and boring case, I know, but I needed to talk about it.So, as the title states, I want to kill myself. Well, that's not entirely accurate. I don't want to commit suicide at all, I just want to stop existing, and suicide seems like the only path there.

So uhm. I don't know if this is the correct subreddit for this sort of thing, but yeah.

I don't really know where to start.

Well, I guess that the most central problem is that I feel like, defective. Like I'm a mistake, like I'm somehow broken, and like I can't do anything about it. I hate basically everything about myself, despite my best efforts to change that. I always try to be the person I think I want to be, and always end up hating myself.

I am also experiencing massive disenchantment with the world, but I'll spare you most of that lest I begin to sound too angsty. The big thing here, though, is that I can't do anything about it. The world will be no better for my being here, and really I feel like it'll be worse.

And, to add onto all of this, what does it matter if I exist anyway? Like, the entire human race could phase out of existence and it wouldn't matter, so why shouldn't I be able to? This isn't a reason for wanting to die, but it's sort of my justification.

The really annoying thing about this is that I don't know why I feel this way. My mom left me at an early age, but I've never cared much about that. I was bullied a bit in elementary school, but that was a long time ago and I'm definitely not bullied anymore. I'm terrified of adulthood, but really I'm pretty intelligent (not bragging, it's just like, a statement of fact, so please don't think I'm bragging) and I'll be able to make a living for myself if I really try. I have plenty of people who care about me. I have plenty of reason to live. But I just feel empty.

Like, when I told my girlfriend that I wanted to kill myself, she said that she would too if I did. Like, not in a creepy suicide pact-y sort of way, just that she'd be very upset by it and blame herself and whatnot. The same thing happened when I told my step-mom. I feel like this should comfort me. Like I should be happy that people care about me that much, but all it does is make me feel trapped. Yeah, it makes me want to stay alive, but not for the right reasons. It feels like I'm being held hostage. 

And. Yeah. I don't know. I just felt like telling someone this stuff. Sorry.",suicide

250393,"I think I‚Äôm at the end nowI don‚Äôt think I ever could have lived for a long time anyway so it‚Äôs not that sad. I‚Äôm eventually going to deal with something that is going to psychologically destroy me anyway. It‚Äôs an inevitability. Just thinking of it constantly is having a pretty bad effect on me. I was just hoping to have a few enjoyable years before I go so I‚Äôm pissed off and venting knowing I‚Äôm going to have to end it. 

I can already barely eat or sleep. There is a waiting list until 2023 before I can even see a psychologist, or a psychiatrist even though I had both when I was 13-15 as a result of a pretty bad situation over the first 12 years of my life. I just want something to get me to sleep and something to help me eat and go about my day. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with so many different things and I was prescribed so much at a young age (13-15). I didn‚Äôt maintain any friends. The things I went through were too traumatic and I can‚Äôt stop thinking of them and reliving it. When I can sleep I just have nightmares. 

Physically, my body has given up on me. I‚Äôm injured physically and it won‚Äôt heal, I‚Äôve spent most of the last few months sick and I keep getting sick. I‚Äôm sick as I write this. The gym was one of the things I‚Äôd always be able to turn to and I don‚Äôt have that anymore. 

I‚Äôm annoyed and angry. I always hoped I‚Äôd at least have some good memory before I died but that‚Äôs not the case. 

This is the first Christmas where I didn‚Äôt get anything at all and didn‚Äôt have anyone to buy anything for. Not even a card. I had one person text me but they texted everyone. Sort of a milestone of how empty and meaningless my life had become. I knew it anyway but it still hurt to see it like that. 

I had $550 in vet bills before Christmas I had to pay. Due to being so sick for the final three months I was barely able to cover my bills and didn‚Äôt earn much of an income since September. I had to use my credit cards a lot. Now they‚Äôre both maxed. One is $80 over limit because of a bill. I have another $800 in bills coming soon. Many due to over limit fees, NSF fees, ongoing expenses for my job. I don‚Äôt have any food or money for food. My bank is overdrawn. My credit is going to take a massive hit on the 11th when everything resets. I also have to pay another $100 for vet bills. 

Truth be told I don‚Äôt even want to do this anymore. I thought I was going to die from my last flu. Part of me wanted to. I was ready. I‚Äôve been keeping a lot of distance from people my whole life but I‚Äôve made much more of an effort to do that since last spring. 

I‚Äôm trying to make it seem like I‚Äôm ok but I can‚Äôt anymore. I don‚Äôt want to live through this and I don‚Äôt want to watch everything get taken from me. I‚Äôm out of resources. I don‚Äôt have a safety net.

105602,"Scared myself todayI'm a 20 year old who lives a decent life, is attending college, and just started a new job as a bank teller. I don't really want to die but I have struggled with suicidal ideation since I was in elementary school. Often, when I have an episode of depression I ponder all the ways I could end it which bums we out even more. I'm also on the autism spectrum so I have a hard time managing my emotions and expressing them to other people. I also have serious social anxiety and have a hard time engaging in meaningful conversations and forming/maintaining new relationships. I don't cut, but I have hurt myself in impulsive rage. None of my friends or family seem to fully understand the extent of emotional pain I am in on a daily basis. My mother is long dead, my relationship with my father doesn't exist, and my stepmother is a toxic and unreasonable alcoholic. The only person in my household I can connect with is my younger brother, but he is going away to college leaving me in a toxic cesspool that is my household. 

Most days I have to force myself to study or do homework which I often procrastinate on. I don't even do anything else to fill the time. I just scroll through Reddit on my phone and rack up the screen time. Sometimes I just curl up on the bed with the shades down and wallow is self pity. Only recent I have made an effort to stop self medicating with weed which has helped but not by much. Also for ten years I had an abusive friend who was manipulative and often criticized me for my social performance. He acted like a crazy, possessive girlfriend and would force me to go to parties and inform me of all the shit people would say about me. On night he even went on a tirade at me and predicted that I would one day kill myself. My other friend, who was there, watched it happen and did nothing. While he is no longer in my life I feel like I will be the victim of the fulfilling prophecy. 

Today I scared myself by drafting a suicide note and am now concerned that my suicidal ideation is getting out of control. Often, I think about killing myself over trivial things that cause me anxiety. In this case it is passing in a garbage paper I know I'm going to fail. While I live in a constant state of anxiety, paranoia, and self loathing, but I don't want to die. I want live and experience life, just not the life I am living. While I know I'm not suppose to be guilty about it, I always feel bad about how materially well off I am but how mentally broken I am at the same time. Really, everything in my life is going relatively well, I have decent grades and am transferring from community college to a four year school, I have money in the bank and a relatively new car, and I just started a new job as a bank teller. When I am not thinking about dying, I am thinking about all the possibilities in life and all of the things I want to do. I don't want to end when there is a possibility it can all get better. To make things worse the one friend I hang out with on a frequent basis is going through his own problems and has chosen to cut himself off from people and as much as I try to reach out to him I get nothing back. I do have a therapist that I see every week and she's great, but there hasn't been much reduction in my suicidal thoughts.

I have some really bad trust and attachment issues because of my dad leaving when I was 5. And then when I was 12, my mom also left(but thankfully my dad took me in and raised me from then on). This has left me in a way that I can only do one of two things. Either not get attached at all, or get extremely attached. But because of the extreme attachment leading to hurt in previous relationships, I had purposefully put space between me and others.


She was the first person in a long time who I really opened up to and let in. I thought she was doing the same to me. We were so insanely close. Then I did one dumbass thing, which I didn't realize was a dumbass thing, and she just turned cold on me. It's like, all the stuff she told me about how much she needed me, how much she loved me and how she would be devastated with me, just disappeared. I've spent the last several weeks trying to fix things, with her warming up a bit, then turning cold, then warming up, then turning cold. I can't put all the blame on her for this. Me going from begging and pleading for forgiveness, to yelling and screaming at her for abandoning me, and then back to the other one, made the situation way worse. But I was at such a low point, I was actually planning my suicide and I was just desperate to have her back. It was so painful and anger inducing that this person, who I gave everything to, didn't even care about it. I put her in front of me. I have suffered, so that I could make sure she didn't. I'm not an innocent angel in all of this. I'm clingy, I'm needy, I'm unstable and high maintenance. I also have extreme mood swings. But I also loved her. Fully and completely. I thought she knew this. 


I was willing to do anything it took to make her want to stay. I tried everything I knew. But it all failed. After one too many fights, things are at a definite end. There is no going back. Now I'm feeling so isolated and alone. The only person I could talk to, hates me. It feels like no one else is even trying to understand me.


To them, ""she's just some girl. Just move on."" They don't know her like I do. She's amazing, in every way. The day after I attempted suicide last March 25th, I was in the emergency room, alone. I was so scared and I had no one to talk to. She called and texted me as much as she could(she works as a waitress). Kept telling me that things will be okay and that she would be there for me. That‚Äôs what made her so special. When everyone else was freaked out and pushed away, she would run forward and try to help me. And I lost that.


All I can think about is that it took me 23 years to meet this one person who I got along with on such a deep level. Is it going to take another 23 to meet the next? And even if I do, they will never be able to replace her. It was nice to be in a relationship(whether it be friends, romantic, or familial) where I felt like I could just fully and completely be myself. I just miss her so much. The depression and stress I'm feeling from this is making my bipolar disorder spin out of control as well, which is just fucking annoying as well. When I met her, I was at a point where all I could think about was killing myself. I felt there was no hope. Nothing would get better. Now, without her, I'm basically back in that headspace and it sucks. I just feel so hopeless and empty. It hurts to breathe. Every morning, I wake up and I feel ok for about a minute. Then reality comes crashing in and I just cry till I can‚Äôt.

6343,"Need to get this weight off my chestI moved away from home to study. Thus I wanted to fulfill one of my almost lifelong dreams. But in reality it turned into a huge disappointment and even worse: since I've been a freshman over here, seperated from my family and the very few 'friends' I have at all, I'm all alone. There's no one here, neither a housemate nor a friend. I also have only few aquaintances here, all of which don't seem to be interested in doing something together. Like I see or hear all the funny and interesting stuff they do on facebook while I'm all alone. Day after day. Moreover I seem to have a crippling anxiety, i.e. talking to people seems to be incredibly difficult or impossible if it's a total stranger.  
  
But who would talk to such a blue and miserable stranger such as me? I start to see myself as a total failure, as someone who's not even worthy of being with others. Nowadays I don't even want to bother others with my presence. I just want to hide and wither away. I'm thinking every day of committing suicide and imagining whether anyone would even notice me being dead, or whether they would care at all. I'm thinking about how to die and what kind of message to leave behind, but in the end I don't do it as if I'm failing even at this. Most likely I don't really want to die. But I don't know what to do. All I know is that I seemingly can't free myself from this constant pain. Only small relieves or diversions are possible, like watching TV, gaming or buying stupid stuff. Though this won't solve my problems rather increase them over time. And not to mention the stinging feelings of guilt afterwards. In the end I'm only functioning, not really living.  
  
Also my dreams, motivation etc. have disappeared. I'm lost without orientation. My intelligence of which I've always been so proud seems to have been lost as well as my ability to memorize stuff. I forget people's names, faces, what I want or need to do and so on. Not to mention what I've been learning these past few years which also has been some sort of my pride, being one of the best among my peers and now falling into mediocrity.  
  
If you don't understand the pride I took in those skills, let me explain that I had always been harassed in kindergarten and throughout school, not only insults and isolation, but also physical injuries. All supposedly because of my intelligence. I didn't have real friends, but I was more intelligent than most of the people, so it was naturally the only thing that I could be proud of.  
  
My parents or sibling didn't help me back then, rather prevented doctors etc. from intervening. Truth to be told, the first time I wanted to commit suicide was when I had been six or seven years old. After my siblings had been picking on me and my parents hadn't listened again, I had wanted to stab a knife through my heart. Imagine a child wanting to kill himself. Not too much has changed actually. At that time I didn't want or rather was afraid of undergoing therapy while now I can't.

I was always willing to be there for her. However, now I can see myself not wanting to always be around her like I used to. We get into passive aggressive arguments about little things.

New school

When I moved about a year ago in to a new school everyone was giving me compliments about how funny I'm and everyone wanted to hangout with me and wanted me in their sport team but they never wanted me to on their ""friends group"". I was completely ignored by them at lunch and I was always alone in the class.


Girls from my new school

Girls gave me lots of attention. I know that at least 4 girls who had a crash on me and did lots of weird things to attract my attention, two of them even told me that but I refused them because I'm not interested in them.


Online friends

I have online friends who are all over 20 and always want me to play with them. They do that because I'm really good at the game, nice and funny, from their own words.


Is suicide a option?

No, suicide its never an option. Even if I never had someone who would support me and I was lonely for most of my life I've never tried to suicide. I've learn to self motivate myself and to escape stress.

I lost my only friend. She meaned so much for me, she was like a real life friend and I lost her. I can never find someone who had showed me that someone can care for me.

Earlier, I told my gf that everyone in my life is only there to make me feel like shit.

295489,"So many thoughts racing in my head...Hello everyone...

Warning: This will not be coherent typing for the most part, I‚Äôm just typing as I‚Äôm thinking. My apologies. 

I‚Äôm a 19 year old college student currently in his sophomore year. This semester has been the hardest. It started off OK, but then I had a mental breakdown and withholding it for so long finally caught up to me. I ended up dropping two of my four courses, even though I told my parents I wanted to drop all of them so I could figure things out, they didn‚Äôt support that and since I go to a community college and live with them I ended up regretfully doing what they told me to do. I just dropped my third class on the final day to drop and now I have three Ws on my transcript. So now I have one class left and I‚Äôm going to get a B in it when it would‚Äôve been an A had I just taken it next semester a as I originally wanted. Depression has been in my life for quite some time. As a kid I was obese and constantly bullied and never had any friends (still don‚Äôt) I changed that my freshman year of high school and lost 127 pounds by the time I was in my junior year of high school. Well, I noticed something was wrong my senior year, I started eating like shit again and was gaining some weight back. I ignored it. Then came freshman year of college, I ended with a 3.5 even though I never let myself study and was invited to an honor society, scholastic leadership and honors classes. Then the problems got worse, I continued to gain weight and I did worse in school. The above mentioned programs I was in, I was kicked out because my gpa dropped to 3.241. Now we‚Äôre to this semester and I feel I‚Äôve fucked up so much and it‚Äôs embarrassing. I gained all the weight back and I‚Äôm just a fat fucking piece of shit. I hate my life and I hate that I‚Äôve allowed myself to fuck me over constantly. When I broke down I finally admitted my problems to my parents as I was worried what they‚Äôd feel like since their ‚Äúgolden child‚Äù is so fucked up mentally and I‚Äôm seeing a counselor but I ended up cancelling last week because I told her the last session I was doing better with eating and getting that on track (that was true) but I ended up fucking up big time and kept eating like shit after doing well for about two weeks. I feel trapped. I feel worthless. I‚Äôm going to see my counselor on Friday and talk about if she‚Äôs willing to provide documentation of my issue to my college so that I can have my withdrawals exempted, but I‚Äôm not sure how that all works and even if I‚Äôll have mine be exempted. I knew I should‚Äôve just took a break from school but I allowed my parents to pressure me into ‚Äúworking it out‚Äù. So now I may be permanently stuck with 3 Ws on my transcript. I didn‚Äôt even want to go to community college but I decided to because I wanted to get into UT Austin, but that‚Äôs not ever happening so I‚Äôve settled on UT Dallas but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs going to be possible either. Funny thing is... I was automatically accepted into UT Dallas out of high school, but no I was a fucking idiot and decided to go to community college because I wanted to go to UT Austin. I‚Äôve fucked up so much and I just can‚Äôt handle it anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel so lost. I want to finish my computer science degree but it‚Äôs just so hard. I really wish my parents would‚Äôve been more supportive of my decision, but I understand why they were so hesitant since they both almost finished college but never did. It‚Äôs just I needed that time and I did get some time to reflect and get help, but not enough. I‚Äôm trying to get back to a normal course load next semester but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs going to be realistic.

I went through all the pain of it, passing clots, bleeding for weeks, but the pregnancy was still there. Got a severe pelvic infection from the tissue getting infected inside of me. It smelled awful. I smelled like blood and roadkill. I couldn't go to work because people complained that ""something smells like blood"". The clinic tried to give me the pill abortion again (I had no one to drive me that day so they couldn't do any surgical procedures on me), and it failed again. Ultimately they had to do a D&amp;C. That's where they scrape out the contents of your uterus. They strapped my legs and arms down on the operation table, and I don't remember much else because of the sedation. I woke up with bruises along my ankles and thighs, so I must've tried to fight back. My body hurt for weeks after that. It must've been extremely painful. 

My boyfriend has always been supportive of me. I got an IUD right after the D&amp;C, but I got it taken out for other medical issues. We were looking at alternative birth control. But I'm pregnant again, and I feel so hopeless. My depression got so much worse after my last pregnancy. I think I'm just going to kill myself so I don't have to deal with this anymore. I feel so stupid for getting pregnant again. I don't want to go through this again. I have medical issues resulting from my last abortion. I have awful pelvic spasms and uterine scarring. I don't want my boyfriend to drive me to the clinic and take care of me again. I'm not a loner by any means, but I don't have a lot of close friends I can talk to. I don't even know if I would even want to talk to them. 

I desperately want to kill myself. I'm sure part of it is just the pregnancy hormones, but I can't help but feel this way. I'm so scared. I don't want to be dependent on my boyfriend again.

101528,"I'm not sure why I'm writing this.My life's a wreck and death is preferable. 

I guess I should start by saying I'm 28 and I have no one in my life anymore except my mother, who I live with. I have been living with her for the last 6 years and became a complete shut in with no motivation to do anything, not even the community service I was given that would keep me out of prison. A sentence I received because I wanted to keep my mother from going away for 4 years, but that can come a little later.

I was born to parents who were 15 and 18, mother father respectively. Both were drop outs but my mother tried to make it work by working two jobs while my father sat at home and fueled his addictions, addictions my fathers mother (my grandmother) blamed and hated my mother for. But as it turned out my 16 year old mom couldn't work two jobs and pay the bills while taking care of a one year old while my father just got drunk and smoked crack, used heroin, on a daily basis. So my mother ended up giving guardianship to my dads parents, and she moved 4 states away to live with her own parents and try to sort her life out. I didn't meet her until I was 10, and I wasn't sure who she was. She sent presents every year for holidays and events, but my spiteful grandmother changed the packaging and labels and never told me who they were from. 

My father bounced around a lot after my mother left him, doing construction jobs to fuel his inclinations. We hardly ever spoke for years, I actually don't think I ever had a conversation with him until I was 16 and only because we started drinking and smoking pot together then. He lived next door to my grandparents once for a couple of years. I'd see him every morning as I went to the bus stop like clockwork puking up his last nights alcohol before starting over again. He never came to my birthdays but I had a cousin my age that was raised by my grandparents too, because his mom my dads sister, was likewise 16 when she had him. Every year for his birthday my aunt would buy him a entire pig and recruit my dad to cook it over night in a pig cooker for him via alcohol and drug bribery. Since his birthday was in July it ended up turning into my dads friends and a bunch of family having parties all July. Its a memory that sticks since he never did anything for me. I assume alcohol or drugs would have convinced him.

This next part is really hard to say... I never told anyone all of this. I was molested ritually by the cousin I had to share a room and bed with for nearly four years, and also by an aunt at the same time despite they never knew each other was doing it. It started when I was 8. I've come to terms with it and it doesn't bother me, and I've spoken to / received counseling about it. That's not what is hard for me.. My cousins mother lived two houses over from my grandparents, and besides my male cousin she also had 3 girls all younger than us. My cousin, their brother, used to make all of us do stuff with him and each other.. I hate that I went along with it, and even more so that I never tried to stop it. But worst of all I went from being an abusee to an abuser myself. As in I ended up doing things with the girls that's making me feel like i can cry right now even thinking about it, just because I guess I was tired of being a victim. 

Fast forward to 10 years old and the return of my mother. My mom showed up one day out of the blue. I guess she had ended up moving back to the same state and ended up getting married and tried constantly to call me and come see me but my grandmother never told me about it, refused her at every turn. She randomly showed up and kept doing so after regularly. She used to beg my grandmother to let me come stay weekends with her and even with me begging she still said no for nearly a year until she finally relented. I started to go alternating weekends and stay with my mom and the man she had married, and honestly it was bliss. I had my own room, I was alone in my own space. I had home cooked meals, not bologna and cheap hot dogs everyday with utensils out of a drawer layered in mouse shit.  (There was roaches at my grandparents too, and I ended up anemic because of lead poisoning from the houses old foundation. It was tore down after being condemned years later.) There was also 4 boys my age near my mother's place that I became fast friends with. I used to dread and hate every time that I had to return back to !y grandparents but being the introverted boy I was I never said a word about it. Any of it actually, but one day I did. I was 12 when I asked my mom point blank if I could live with her permanently. She immediately hired a lawyer in secret and started the court process. Within a year I was living with her, but it was far from simple and it left me with a mental image of my grandmother that sticks with me even now 16 years later. 

I had just gotten home from school and came home to find my grandfather waiting to direct me to their bedroom where I found my grandmother streaming tears and screaming at me. You see she had just had a risky open heart surgery a few months prior, and she had just received a phone call and found out that my mother had hired an attorney. She didn't start screaming until she asked me if it was true and I told her flat out yes, I wanted to live with my mother. She yanked down her shirt and pointed to her scar and screamed that everything she had been through was for me, that I was abandoning her for that worthless bitch and I was breaking her heart. The next few months went by in a haze where she refused to even talk to me. I bottled it up like I did with everything, tucked it under the scars and put it in the void. (I forgot to mention my cousins mother and my uncles and aunts were extremely abusive. I've been stomped at 6 years old by a 300 pound woman for sitting too close to the TV and not moving back when she asked me to. That ended up with 4 broken ribs and shitting and puking blood for a week. The same woman also hit her own son with a frying pan full of hot grease because he snagged a piece of bacon, he has permanent white splotches down his neck from it even years later.) But a few months go by with my grandmother ignoring me while the court process went on, until eventually I was called up to be spoken to in private with only the judge, attorneys, and myself present, because of my age. I remember being asked a few questions and the judge deliberated with the attorneys before flat out saying he was going to leave me with my grandparents. I snapped, emotions just poured out and I cried for the first time in my life as I broke down, it all poured out. The abuse, the state of the house and my living conditions, everything. The judge dismissed us and told the attorneys that none of that was to leave the room. But it did leave the room. I knew as soon as I saw my grandparents return to the car where I was waiting after court ended. No one said a word but I knew. We went home and my father was waiting. He looked me dead in the eye and told 12 year old me I was a ""little fuck liar."" Two months pass and still my grandmother wouldn't so much as sit in the same room with me when I was home from school. The court order finally came through and my mother came to my school at the end of the year and picked me up as a surprise, taking me to my new home. My grandparents found out and called the police but nothing could be done, my mother had her rights back. The only addendum was that I now had mandatory visits back to my grandparents on alternating weekends and summer vacations. But that didn't exactly pan out. My grandmother died of a heart attack at home within a week of me moving to my mothers. I can still remember the looks I received the weekend I showed up, remember the way she told me I had killed her, and I can remember my cousin telling me I killed her after she actually died. I saw that they blamed me. All of them, and it was never the same. Even at her funeral I couldn't cry. For 26 years the only tears I ever shed were in that court room. My mother went to her funeral with me and even she was crying about it and they hated each other. But life went on.

From 13 - 17 I was happier than I had ever been, I was in a supporting and caring home with a non abusive family and friends and a good school life. But around 16 the rebellious stage kicked in. I started becoming mischievous, smoking cigarettes, weed, drinking. I was eben doing it with my father on my trips back to my grandparents. The abuse stopped once I moved out of course and none of us ever spoke about the things we had done, my cousin, the girls, we all buried it under a rug. But my happiness turned to resentment as I noticed my mother was far too lenient. She could never bring herself to punish me for anything I did. Stealing money, smoking, none of it. Shed attempt to ground me and falter the next day. I knew it was guilt on her part but I couldnt help but push the limits, going so far as to skipping school when I got my license with more days missed than went by a long shot. I was expelled my junior year, yet even though I knew my mother was angry she never showed it. And like a shark I went at that weakness. Now I know I just wanted her to scream at me, I wanted to be told I was a fuck up and to get my shit together. But she never did. In fact the happy little life on the outside crumbled too, when I was 17. 

My mother got into a bad car accident and ended up on disability. She was a nurse but she was no longer allowed to work. She was given pain meds after back surgery for years and it changed her. Her relationship with my stepfather crumbled and she ended up moving out, leaving me with him, to stay with one of their mutual friends. He thought it was temporary and didn't mind me staying there with him but aftrr a year of her being gone that changed too, even more so when it came out that my mother was fucking her friends husband, the married man she was staying with and also my step dads best friend. It caused massive problems. When this all happened I was 17, close to 18, but it opened my eyes. On my own I enrolled in an alternative school and crammed a years worth of classes in one semester so I could enroll back into my primary highschool. I ended up graduating on time by my own graces but by the time I did I was 18 and still staying with my stepdad. He had always been an alcoholic, drinking acase a day but he was never violent. But once it came out what my mother had done he, rightfully, was pissed. He started drinking liquor oiut of the bottle, talking to himself at night, glaring at me when I came home from school or work. I knew I was no longer welcome and I didn't blame him. My mother left for a year to fuck his best friend while I was left there like luggage. Not long after that my mother and stepdad filed for divorce and my mother and I ended up moving to a small trailer a county a way. I applied for college but because of my rebelliousness I needed a few credits more than what I had and was rejected. My only option was to do community college for a year before I would be accepted to uni, but at this point I had a pretty good job for a kid right out of highschool. Good enough that I was essentially paying for the small trailer and the bills all on my own, seeing as my mother was kicked out of pain management for smoking weed and she spent her meager income on pills. Most of my friends had moved on by now, gone on to join the military or off to uni. And then I got hooked on pills too. 

I started taking them around 19, and I truly loved the feeling. I saw immediately why my mother liked them so much. For a person who was always numb inside it was like a warm fuzzy blanket. We lived there like that for a year before my mother decided she couldn't handle being so near to the rumors and snarky comments anymore. (It was a small country town, stepdad was a farmer and everyone knew each other and even though we moved a county over it was still on the outskirts of the county line, closer to the city I went to school in and my job.) So she decided she was going to move back to rent a house next her own parents back in her home state. I decided I wasn't going to go. I had a good job and a few friends around still, sadly only junkies like myself at that time too, so I stayed on my own from 19 - 20. The whole while my usage just upped and upped until I was paying my entire rent on drugs and owed everyone I knew money. So I said fuck it one day after a year and called my mom and asked to move in and she said yes. I had a sort of epiphany, that I was just like my father during that year and that realization made me quit on the spot. I moved 4 states away to where I knew no one because I knew it was the only way I'd ever give up my bandaid that was opiates. So that's what I did. Of course, it was harder than I thought it would be.

You see the house my mother rented was next door to my moms parents, my other grandparents. And my grandfather was prescribed / still is prescribed morphine because of cancer. He doesn't even have half of a lower jaw anymore because the bone had to be removed and the cadaver graft failed. Not to mention my great uncle, my grandfather's brother was the one who owned the home my mother rented and he was a pill head too. He his it from his wife and used the rent money to buy his own drugs. The town we moved to ended up being far worse than the small country town I left drug wise, and trying to go cold Turkey when I have family members around that would just give me whatever I wanted if I asked was not easy, but I spent three months holed up until finally the worst was over. I had a relapse or two but every time I realized that I was just like my family I'd quit again. I ended up finding a job and this lasted for nearly 4 years. But of course having pill heads around each other wouldn't last. My uncle who kept stealing the rent for drugs was lying to his own wife about it and they ended up getting a foreclosure on the land where we lived as well as my grandparents next door and suddenly we all 4 were homeless. They quickly rented a small trailer and I spent 2 months sleeping on a porch in an Ohio winter with nothing but a tarp nailed to the outside. My mom slept with my grand!other while my grandfather slept in his rocking chair. It was a low point for sure. The job I had paid shit wages and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't find anything better. Then I lost my job, my license, my car, all right together. I had a traffic ticket from my old home state I had forgotten about that caught up in the me when I tried to renew my license for that state. So I did a title loan on my car to quickly pay it off but within a few days I was fired from my job for texting in the parking lot. (Yes, I'm dead serious. It was Union contracted and extremely strict.) My mother and I ended up moving in with a disabled bed ridden man who was a family friend. On top of is staying there he also paid my mother for taking care of him (think home nurse) and I went along because he lived near a major city. Way more job opportunities. It took six months of me job hunting to find a job and when I finally did the man we stayed with passed away within weeks and we were back to homeless and caught in a court battle over his assets because the man was wealthy and had added my mother to his will. A move the mans family was deeply upset about. He was never married and childless, so they were direct relatives. We ended up back at my grandparents while the court proceedings went on for that, which meant my carless self couldn't drive an hour with no license to work and seeing as I had not made any friends at all in my time here I didn't have a choice. My mother eventually got her ""inheritance"" and put a payment on a house. Her inheritance came in two major checks at separate times but the realtor allowed her to make a huge down payment with a promise to pay another 20k in a few months as that was what the down payment should have been. It should have been easily doable considering the amounts she was receiving but it turns out that second 20k payment never made it to the realtor, instead she spent it all on pills over a 3 month span. We lost the house and back to homeless. Luckily that was short lived as she found a boyfriend to live with and I stay there now too. But a lots happened over the last few years. 

I haven't spoken to a single one of my family members from my father's side in 10 years at least, though I did see an news article where my felon father got caught with an ounce of heroin a few years back and got 20 years for it. He has a long prior record, boasting even a statutory rape charge and the only family I had left here all hate each other now. My mother and her parents refuse to speak as well as my pill head uncle. I likewise got into a little trouble for driving under a suspension trying to dig myself out of debt enough to get my license back. This is why I'm now a felon myself and likely going to prison in a month. A few years back my mother sent me to my grandparents out of nowhere, she told me they called and begged to borrow money and asked me to take it to them so I did. I got there and grandfather asked me to take him to the store as his car was messed up and he needed some stuff so I agreed. He got some groceries and I took him home and went to make the hour drive back to where we were staying at the time. I moved over for a passing ambulance and didn't used my blinker and was pulled. I knew my license was invalid and if I was unlucky the car would be towed. I figured worse come to worse I'd just have to sit for 30 minutes waiting on my mother to come get me but it was worse than that. Turns out during inventory of the car there was a bottle of morphine unlabeled under the passenger seat. I knew right away what happened and called my mother furious. In the end the cop gave me a citation and took a statement regarding the pills, where I said they weren't mine obviously. But the cop said to wait and they would decide whether to charge me after the pills were tested in the lab, and if I hadn't heard anything in 6 months then likely I wouldn't be charged. Fast forward 2 years of silence and the incident all but forgotten and I have two us marshals and two local cops knocking on my door with a secret indictment. I went to jail for a few weeks and was released on bond while the rest played out, but I ended up with a court appointed attorney who flat out said the only way I'd get out of it is if my mother took the blame. Well she had been caught with illegal pills already too, and though she became a felon she only ended up with 5 years probation. If she took the blame she wpiuld have gone to prison. I didn't have a single thing on my record besides traffic tickets so I took a plea deal with the plans to do my 10 days in jail and get out on probation with the remaining year over my head in the hopes of doing what I needed to do and having it expunged. Yet here I am now, report twice a month a year and a half into my probation and I still haven't done a single hour of the 120 I need. I've tried but it just doesn't work out. I have no motivation do anything anymore. For the last year I've spent all my time job hunting and I've had a few who were interested until the word felon came up. The closest place to do community service to my house is walking distance away, but they don't take felons. 

I've essentially just given up, I genuinely don't care about anything and I never really have. I did see a psychiatrist a few years back where I received a antisocial personality diagnosis. I was given meds that never worked, sent to counseling and therapy too but to be honest it hasn't helped in the slightest so I gave that up too. And while I typed out a good bit of my life story here I realize fully that it paints me as a victim in most of it, but I'm not. The truth is I'm a horrible fucking person. Ive done a lot of seriously horrific shit that I'm not proud of by any means. I haven't had a girlfriend in 6 years and I've never had a relationship last more than 3 months. I just can't do it. I'm empty inside and have no drive or prospects. Most of my friends or girlfriends I've always fucked over by playing little games like a psychopath because I just can't let anyone get close to me anymore. I truly can't. I've only had two meaningful relationships in my life. One with a girl that I think I truly loved but it was fucked up. I was overbearing, jealous, paranoid, abusive, insecure to the max... I treated her like shit. And I knew I was doing it and couldn't stop and she was too good of a person to be crying every day. So I just cut her off and left. The other was my child hood friend that i met when I first moved in with my mother. One of the four guys. We were inseparable for years but life happened and we drifted apart, though we did speak for years after and meet up whenever he had leave from the airforce. Which is something I was declined from as I am mostly deaf in my right ear from where my cousin shot a shotgun next to my head and perforated an eardrum while we were hunting as teens. I couldn't even join the army during the war, something I genuinely wanted to do. (Yeah, I know now that sounds.) So here we are. No prospects, rapidly approaching 30, living with my mother, a convicted felon who's likely going to prison within weeks or months. Depending on how long I can use my psychopathic charm to sway my po with lies, and it just seems so fucking stupid. I'm right back where I was at 10 years ago. My mother has changed with her addiction issue too. We never talk anymore, and haven't for years. When I ask her something I usually get a bitter snappy answer because her boyfriend now is an alcoholic too, but one of the stupid fucking kinds who likes to run his mouth and scream over menial shit. I've already had her drag me off of him because I had him against a wall and was strangling him after I got tired of hearing his drunk ass calling her names loud enough the neighbours could hear. The house were staying in is three stories including the basement, which is a separate homestead and where they stay. I sit in the upper two stories of this house all alone and have done so for the last 2 years. All I do is think about shit now. I've never really done that before, I usually am always optimistic and try to think everything will work out in time but the truth is that I'm tired of waiting. The truth is I'm more of a parasite now. My closest friend from back in the day was more of a rival in that we were always challenging each other in everything. Who got the most girls, who was better at sports or fighting, and whatever else. It wasn't the type of relationship where sharing was a possibility. I've tried talking to my mother genuinely about myself, where my heads at, and it ended up with her bawling and running out of the room within five minutes. So I've never really had anyone I could talk to. I really haven't. The only girl I've ever loved I was too scared to pursue because I know myself too well. And that's even with her actively pursuing me back. I just couldn't put her through that. Not her. And to be honest the only reason I haven't killed !myself now is because of my mother and only her. 

She's headstrong and hates people that fucks her over and she is almost always a raging bitch but inside she's a big softie who cried for a week when her pet rabbit died. A 40 year old woman crying over a pet rabbit.. What would a dead son make her do? I may not feel guilt personally but I know what it is all too well, and I can't do that to her. I can't let her find me at least, so my plan is to pack up a bag and some supplies and just head out into nature as far as I can and do it there. My mother knows me well enough to know that I'm the type of person who can cut off a relationship at the drop of a dime. So long as I'm never found by her then that's fine by me and if im never found at all that's all the better. I'm giving it a week.

I have never attempted to suicide before but I have had a few near death experiences. I've been shot during an incident back when I was doing drugs a lot, I've accidentally hung myself before, ive overdosed and passed out for three days where my old ""friends"" just took my money and my car and left me for dead, and I've drowned and had to be resuscitated. I know full well that I have a strong will to live and I know how that rush of chemicals after feels, how relieved and life changing it can be, but I've made up my mind. The truth is I really don't want to live in this society at all. My minds fucked and bitter and I don't deserve to be happy because I only bring misery along. For 26 years I walked through life like a metronome, a shell of a person just existing only because I can, because I was therefore I am. Its only in the last 2 years out of my 28 that I've stopped and allowed it all to ruminate. The worst part is that I can cry now somehow, but its always over stupid shit. A movie or a manga I read, but real life nothing affects me. This isn't living, its just existing. I don't resent it or anything that's happened in the past, I just want to end it. Whether there's a heaven, hell, absolutely nothing, a Valhalla, or any of that doesn't matter. I just want out of this menial existence of isolation. Sure I could find a job and slave away earning scraps of paper but I know I still wouldn't be happy. So I'm done. 

My bags already packed and waiting for my hike. I'm not leaving a note or even a hint about what I'm doing and that's for the best. Only one person would know anyway and while I'm emotionless I don't get off on hurting others. Its disgusting. I just want to disappear so that's what I'm going to do.",suicide
146186,"I have a friend who is going through hard times and keeps talking about wanting to commit suicide. What can I do?I have a friend and co-worker who is going though very tough financial and marriage issues at the moment, and she keeps talking about her desire to commit suicide.  Long story short, Her husband lost his job and company car back in July.  She is now the sole earner in her family and is trying to support her Husband and 2 children on her salary, which is not that good.  In addition to working her regular 8-5pm job, to make ends meet, she also works as call operator for our company every evening and night.  So she has essentially been working around the clock since July.  Her husband has not been proactive about getting a new job and he has sort of ""checked out"" in helping around the house.  She says he refuses  to help clean, or cook, or do much of the ""home-maker"" duties while she is at work during the day and waits for her to come home and cook and do the laundry etc.  She says she feels, trapped and suffocating and is not sure how much longer she can last.  Her son also needs special ADHD treatment and behavioural counsuling which she cannot afford since her Husabnd lost his job.  So yeah, she is having some hard times.  She has attempted suicide in the past and her Brother committed slow suicide from Alcohol abuse.  I want to be able to help her, but honestly, I have no idea what to do.  I help her out by driving her back and forth from work since we live near each other so her husband can use the car to look for work or run errands, but I think she needs to talk to someone, a professional.  I don't think my advice is helping, or even qualifies as help.  I am honestly worried.",suicide

308542,"The Abyss has taken me and it won't let goI used to think suicide was for the weak. That I would never let myself fall into such a thing. I never understood why people would do it.
But I have stared into the abyss and now... Maybe I should. 

It's probably very clich√© to say, but I feel like I'm the only one like me. A few days ago I came to see a friend under a new light. I thought they were like me. I value the mind above all, and they seemed to do the same. We have been friend for years, and we've shared ideas and thoughts on every and anything. But a week ago I told them about it. 
You see my concept of love is not like most people's. I am the most loyal person you will ever find. I do not enjoy romance, I enjoy the union of the mind. And I thought my friend was like this. She was not.
And now I am lost. It is something I imagine when you find someone you love, and you want to stay with them but this is different. It's like my mind was shattered and I don't know what to think. Without them I am lost. Imagine if the voice in your head suddenly disappeared. With them gone everything also crumbles. Everything I thought I wanted, everything I thought I had under control I realize now that they held my thoughts in place. 

All of what I'm thinking now, I've thought it a million times over, before I met my friend. And she knew everything. She knew more than I could ever hope to know and all I wanted , all I crave is a connection of the mind. It doesn't happen often. Only a handful of times in my lifetime and Everytime they leave I feel shattered. The very first time wasn't so bad because he moved to another city but we kept in touch. 
But this time is worse than all other. It's like being a drug addict but having no more drugs. And these drugs are not ones you can buy. They only happen by chance. 

So now I'm left again with no one to echo my thoughts. All I think is, why me. Why can't I be like everyone else. I deeply want to be normal. Normal people they are content having a relationship, forming a family, having a job that pays well.

I would rather die than have this. I need to do something. Something bigger than me, something that matters. I don't care for family or love. Yet I am ever so stupid that I can't do anything and now I don't even have anyone to talk to. It kills me inside.

Have you ever thought about why we are? I'm sure everyone has come to the realization that nothing means anything all you do is pointless. Yet we forget it quick. Not me. It's all I think about now. I need someone to be a catalyst to my thoughts because I can't escape this by myself. 

I dream to be the savior of the world but I can't even save myself from the knowledge that there is no such thing and that even if there was it would be pointless. I am too stupid to be anyone's savior and since nothing is worth anything then maybe I should go gentle into that good night. 

I know my family will be sad , but over time they will forget. As for me I'm not afraid of death  , I've always been curious about what happens. I'm just afraid that if I live, I will waste my life.",suicide

23815,"I need help/adviceI‚Äôve been considering suicide for a few days now. I've almost attempted it previously (around half a year ago). But back then i wanted to get better and not feel suicidal so i went and talked to a close friend and she was able to convince me out of it. Talking to her made me feel a lot better.

I don't have any close friends anymore or anyone to talk with. I'm an extrovert and i can get a long pretty well with people. Like I'm great with introverts as well. But I'm terrible at maintaining relationships. It's been a few years since I've had anyone i could call a best friend. I'm great at conversations the first few days but later on i just turn into a boring person and it feels like people don't want to talk to me. I know that they might just be busy but I'm very sure that's not the case. I might just be bad at this. 

I feel horrible whenever people jokingly say everyone hates me. Even worse when they mean it as an insult. I remember every person that has said this to me and their words repeat in my head everytime i break down. Deep inside i honestly feel like I'm being a bother to everyone. Like they just put up with me and I'm not interesting at all. Basically I'm that awkward guy standing outside friend circles. I'm sorry if i annoyed anyone by doing this. 

It's the same with my family members except for the part where i know that they are bothered by me. If i talk about this with my parents they'd brush this aside saying that I'm just saying stuff to make them look bad and what I'm going thru is nothing (i have actually tried once and i got this answer). 

This is really cliche and you all might hear this a lot but romance has a bit to do with this as well. There are girls that have had feelings for me (even from the ones i liked) but a lot of them got disinterested in me after talking or hanging out with me for a few days. I'm not the type that says offensive or indecent things. I'm either annoying or not interesting. I've confirmed all this.

My mom abandoned me when i was a little kid. I found out somewhat recently and this just makes me feel like i wasn't really wanted. And this is really lame but i get depressed by those ""you're an accident"" jokes, i try really hard to hide it because it's just a joke that people usually say without ill will and unaware of what i went through.

So basically i feel like someone who's just a bother to everyone and that no one wants to be around me. I don't have any friends or family members i can talk to and i honestly think killing myself is the only way out. I've been feeling horrible for a few years now.

suicide prevention isn't about care. its about money and a pat on the back. always has been and always will be.

we use guilt and others feelings to say why its wrong. which actually proves the person is right NOT wrong. if you can't think of one reason it would help them you likely are wrong in saying they shouldnt and also likely wrong they are truly helping others. (if they can't help themself they can't help others we actually teach this {can't fill from empty cup} )  


next we make false promises. it gets better. no statistically it gets worse not better #sorrynotsorry it was a mis-informed program for bulling in schools and it actually failed even for that. stop spreading it.  
we make other promises but don't personally verify or have anyway to make sure they have a reasonable chance of being true. STOP DOING THIS! you prove their suicide was right. and that you lied. last thing you need when you need them to trust you. #don'tmakeapromiseyoucantkeep  


stop making it a actual CRIME to attempt suicide. great proof there its not about helping but money. YES look it up is is a crime in the books or used to be. but the successful completion is not.  


AND MOST IMPORTANTLY if they say its FINANCIAL related the ABSOLUTE WORSE THING YOU CAN DO is to GIVE them ANOTHER BILL... that means the WORST POSSIBLE thing is to call the cops on them.  
you an't cute. you aint doing the right thing. your teaching them A: you don't care about legal or financial issues for them. B: that prob makes them more suicidal and more likely to attempt.  
C: its a dick move and proof the healthcare system and mental isnt about saving lives BUT making money.  


remember its NOT asked for by the person, non consent treatment. PROVEN to not be medically necessary in majority of cases and actually more likely to cause harm. WHY THE F$&amp;$&amp;&amp;$ should i have to pay one dime for it. oh yeah because its a LEGAL thing not even a medical and untill after the asseement its more less practicing medicine without a license. (the cop isnt trained for this; many require a medical doctor to interact, but most don't actually do this)  


you want to save someone form suicide DON""T EVER CALL 911 on them. you 100% of the time do not improve the situation this has been proven. you can't stop them from doing it. and you WILL 100% of the time lose a friend for it. and make them for up to 3 months MORE likely to actually die then before.    


\^\^\^ needs to be teached rather than the outdated lie.  if you really want to help BE there in person. otherwise you can't help by a phone call to police. which for some groups that alone can make sure you can find out the person died instead. some like LGBT and POC actually that alone is the most likely to end up with them dead by the police.   


better yet if you don't even know if they are at work or home DON""T FRI\*ING CALL. i was pulled out of work and lost pay and socked with a 2.5K medical bill you don't think i was less. i actually attempted AFTER that when i had no intent before.

I used to cut myself all the time, in my head I did it for attention, I wanted people to notice and ask me if I was okay so I could say that I wasn't and they safely tuck me away in a hospital for crazies and the doctors would spend months trying, unsuccessfully, to break through my emptiness. The reality was that I was so scared of people seeing my cuts that I hid them the best I could, despite having hundreds at any one time, my family had no idea until I flipped out at school. I was sitting in some stupid class, I think we had a relief teacher, it was a class where you could sit and talk with your friends and do nothing and the teacher wandered around doing sweet fuck all. I don't know why but I grabbed a Stanley knife and sliced into my arm multiple times, I remember it stinging so bad because there were so many lighter cuts underneath them. I laughed, I felt like I had something to prove. A boy saw the blood and told the teacher, she came over and I said he was lying but she wouldn't leave me alone so I pulled up my jumper sleeve and screamed at her to fuck off as I ran out.
I don't remember what happened next but my parents were told about it and I'd left the school grounds. The school councillor found me and for some reason I agreed to go with him to hospital. He took me to be evaluated by a child shrink, I barely said a word and I didn't look at him once, I felt like I was in a trance, the air around me felt so cold and heavy. It was decided that I was perfectly sane and didn't need any sort of help what so ever. The councillor took me home and my parents asked to see my cuts before never mentioning it ever again!

So anyway, I continued to lead a destructive lifestyle, most weekends were spent wiping myself out with a bottle of straight bourbon or vodka. I hung out at local music gigs with my friends, many of them much much older than myself. I did things to the extreme because it made me popular, not always in a good way. I went out of my way to stand up for my behaviour so if someone in our extended friends circle thought I was a dick, I'd push and push until their close friends liked me and they'd eventually give in and treat me nicely too. 

Meanwhile I was a straight A student.. my parents worked a lot, they didn't pay much attention to my schooling, my grades weren't bad so they didn't give it a second thought. In fact, they saw me as being responsible. I often babysat my little sisters, one of them from when she was only a few months old. I wouldn't abandon them or throw parties or anything, but I did play horrible mind games with them and they'd never tell because I'd scared them into believing that was worse than whatever I'd tricked them into thinking had happened/was happening. 

All of this stuff, it was selfish. I wanted to be the rebellious renegade cool kid, but my parents and to a point, my teachers, were fed this bullshit goody two shoes image that they fell for. This is how I got away with never doing my hometown, handing in essays late, wearing incorrect uniform everyday, never doing exams, never paying attention, spending most of my time in the classroom yelling and laughing and making excuses. Looking back I can honestly say that I am amazed at how much shit I got away with and that I finished school.

I found comfort in typing to a select few male friends for hours upon hours. I often developed crushes on them but they never went much further than sex, i was young and they were often in their early 20's. One guy in particular sticks in my head, not sexually or anything, we never even went there back then, in fact he broke his hand after punching a tree at his birthday party because he felt so bad that I was so attached to him at the time. So that was my first real broken heart, our friendship was awkward for a while and then I moved away and we have barely spoke since.

As a teenager I threw massive tantrums, but I didnt realise the extent of them until the last few years when I discovered that I have black outs where I am in an uncontrollable rage. I remember my parents holding me down at 15 to check for track marks on my arms, I must have been pretty psychotic for them to accuse me of being a junkie. Teen angst I assumed, but 10 years on my episodes have only gotten worse.

This is already a stupidly long story, I don't even tell this to my shrink, so I'll summarise the rest quickly.. my family moved several hours away when I was in my second last year of school, I hated my new school, I felt so stupid and lost and uncomfortable. I got pregnant, had a secret abortion and never forgave myself. I moved back and lived in a granny flat with one of my sisters. Finished school but things just went ever the same. I'd discovered drugs. Pills and speed. My school friends didn't understand.. I moved back to the city near my parents. The guy I got pregnant to had hung around and I was living with him until I realised I had only stayed with him because I was a mess after the baby thing.. he got abusive when I left him.. not wanting my parents to judge me or seem weak, I kept living with my ex, filing in my weekends with raves and a rebound guy. One thing that did impact my life at this point was ghb, considered a dirty scum drug, I had a big crazy image to build to ensure I was popular in this new scene.. it was easy, I had nothing to live for, I hated myself for what I'd done and the more I partied, the less I had to stop and deal with the consequences. I ended up in an ambulance 3 times in 6 weeks.. I passed out and woke up in some random guys bed with him fucking me.. I ran away and went back to the club.. I met a guy that loved going out too, but knew I needed help, so he wouldn't let me out of the house no matter how much I kicked and screamed. We went out for a year but we were bad for each other, we substituted ghb with speed and were still taking ghb when we could.
I spent 9 destructive months after he left me, in pieces. My friends saw the tantrums, one night 3 male friends tried to stop me from hurting myself but I am stupidly strong in these rages and I managed to smash my head into the concrete several times until they let me go, and then I ran and ran and don't remember the rest.
Ghb was ruining me again.

I met a guy from the rave scene, I didn't think I was ready to leave my ex in the past but I decided to give it a chance. So glad I did, best thing that ever happened to me. We moved in together after only a few weeks and 5 years on were engaged.

I don't want to disclose the finger details in this time but I will say that whilst I'm a better person, we still give in to temptations just as often, and I still have anger issues, but until recently I hadn't wanted to hurt myself like I do right now.

My sister died a short time ago. Overdose. But on opiates.
It's not real to me, it confuses me, I can't make sense of it.
I don't want to deal with it.

I was diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety disorders including mild OCD about a year ago.
Since my sister died my OCD is my way of coping.. things that used to be funny but necessary to me, now physically hurt if I don't do them or if I do them wrong.

I can't help but think that my childhood desire to have people feel sorry for me, paved the way to becoming that person. Sometimes I wonder if it's just all in my head, if I don't completely believe that I'm sick, how will I ever help myself?

When I get angry I often black out, my partner tells me what happened each time, I've tried to jump out of his car at high speeds on a freeway, drank bleach, tried to grab a gun off a police officer, hit my head so many times it's not funny, taken pills, blah blah, right now it all seems like a good idea.

I feel so selfish.

113486,"Stuck in an existence I wish never came to be in the first placeI came from a high school in Silicon Valley, where my classmates were killing themselves left and right.
I've felt strong urges periodically but never did anything about them.

I decided to go all in on life, to pour everything I had in it in the hope that it would get better in time. In time the pain would go away and I would be happy.

When the pain lingered I kept telling myself the same thing: 'Just wait another year. Life can change so quickly, in a year your life will be way different. You might look back on this time a year from now shocked that you thought about suicide because life is so good for you now.' That change has never come. Sure my life has changed, but my desire to live has not. To make things even worse, I achieved a ton in the past several years, and I feel worse than ever. I accomplished several things that I thought would make me happy, would finally kick me out of the rut I was in. But the rut persists.

Many times since I first had a strong urge to kill myself seven years ago, including tonight, I've looked back on my life and realized that I should have just killed myself back then. Nothing got better, and to make matters worse, I made several other people's lives worse. I broke the hearts of three girlfriends, I left them and wrecked their lives for some time. They would not have gone through that pain if it wasn't for me.

I sincerely want to kill myself, but I won't because of what it would do to my family. I wish, so strongly sometimes, that I had never existed in the first place. The world would genuinely be a better place without me. So much fucking better. I'm stuck and I don't know what to do. Stuck in an existence I wish never came to be in the first place.",suicide

I think I've always considered suicide an option. And that's part of the reason I'm still alive. If killing myself is an option. Then facing what's put infront of me is also an option. And I'm doing it by my own will and I am not forced to face anything.

By my own will I've lived thus far and reached this much.

Well. Today I think that I'm finally there. At the point where I think I've had enough. That I can't take it anymore.
For years I've been depressed. Social alienation. An unstable and unsafe living environment and being raised by a dysfunctional family left me with all kinds of shit and baggage to carry with me. I've never been in a successful friendship. I've only been in an emotionally draining romantic relationship. And the only feelings I still have are at someone who would never view me the same way.

My parents are finally having a divorce. However. It's not the way I ever imagined a divorce would go down.
I always imagined my parents just solving their issues on a table with their lawyers. Sign a contract or some shit and then get on with their lives.
But apparently not. Divorces are much more childish and stupid. By both parties.
Both my parents are being manipulative to me and my brother who is outside the country right now.

And to top it all off. In less than 5 days. I have finals. And those finals in this specific year will dictate how my entire life will go because of my country's shitty educational system.
I am honestly just too tired.

127041,"I'm posting this at work because I'm so overcome with depression today I can't handle anything else......yet I can't afford to lose any more hours at work, so I'm forced to stay here and suffer.

I hate my job. I'm single because my ex was extremely non-communicative, and I suspect asexual...even though I don't doubt she cared about me, she was ridiculously emotionally inaccessible, and a terrible communicator.

I started dating someone I really liked for awhile, but she broke it off because her own depression got too much to handle a relationship...I completely respect her for doing it, but the weird thing is, I miss her more than my earlier, more long-term ex...maybe I'm just hung up on her because we broke it off before we had a chance to sleep together. I dunno.

I lost my dog this year, who I'd known since she was a puppy. I lost my last remaining grandparent. I lost a close college friend to suicide. I was gaslighted out of a line therapy job I was really good at and loved; I was bumped to starting pay, had benefits stripped, had my hours cut, and all my favorite clients were taken away...all to cover the asses of my dipshit privileged bosses. Earlier this year I had a stomach ulcer. My daily depression and anxiety attacks have been getting worse and worse. The last 3 mental health professionals I saw didn't help...one referred me to a psychiatrist, who recommended a ton of really scary, invasive drugs without trying milder ones first - the third I saw yesterday, who referred me to yet more people who will no doubt waste my time and money further. I've been building a legal case against my crooked ex-landlady but I can't afford a lawyer so at this point, she's probably going to get away with all her fuckery. I filed an official complaint with the Department of Consumer Protection, but they're slow as hell, and refuse to offer legal advice. I hooked up with someone who turned out to have mega unhealthy attachment issues...when I broke things off with her, she bombarded me with abusive texts for a day and a half, then told me she loved me, then continued sending abusive texts until I stopped responding to her completely. 

All this has been my life for the past 10 months. I lean really hard on my friends by venting to help me get through the day, but I can tell it's getting hard on them. 

I don't know what kind of work I want to do next. All the fun jobs don't pay enough, all the ones that do pay as much as I'm making now ($12/hour - no benefits) are just as soul-crushing as my current job. All the jobs I apply to with a decent balance of both compensation and work I actually think might be fun are either taken before I can apply, or I'm outright rejected because I'm still young and don't have any fucking experience yet. I'm drowning in debt. I'm flailing. My parents are both abusive idiots who never make me feel anything but worse after I talk to them. I keep sinking lower but I don't know what to do.

I'm 25. My life is 1/3rd over and I've spent most of it getting abused and feeling miserable over and over again...everyone I ask for help either tells me they can't, takes advantage of me, or tries to help but fails spectacularly. Every time I try to help myself, by working up the gumption to apply for a job I'm actually interested in, my efforts blow up in my face and push me deeper into the spiral.

I don't know what to do. I don't know what the fuck I should do. I don't know if I even believe the 'it gets better' shit because for the past 13 years, my life has only gotten marginally better. I worked my ass off in college so this exact situation wouldn't happen. I pushed thoughts of suicide out of my head when I was a teenager because I dismissed everything as ""just par for the course of dealing with high school""; I bargained with myself that I wouldn't think about things like this again until after high school, when things were supposed to 'get better'...but they haven't. Not really.

This has been one of the worst years of my life. On par with my Middle School years, which says a fucking lot. I don't believe the universe is going to pull off some kind of balancing act just for me - just because I've been through hell this year doesn't mean something at the end of the tunnel is waiting for me. I've learned that much about life.

I just...I just want to be done with all of this. I don't want depression. I don't want anxiety. I don't want post-traumatic stress. But nobody can or will help me. Even myself.

I am on disability pension and nearly every day just consists of trying to get my own laundry and cooking and cleaning done. My medical problems are getting worse and it probably won't be long before I need outside help to do those things. There is virtually no chance I will be able to do a worthwhile or fulfilling job.

I have only ever had one partner, she was violent and emotionally and financially abusive but having a companion made it worthwhile, given how lonely I was before (and since). I doubt I will be able to find someone willing to date a disabled and unemployed man but even then my trauma from being beaten by my ex-wife wouldn't let it work.

I only have social contact about 3-4 times a month - mostly through my disability support group, occasionally there is a meetup I can go to. I don't have many friends and none of them see me regularly. Some of them disassociated from me because when my wife was abusive they took me for the abuser because gender. Some of them live far away, mostly they are just too busy to care.

I've been trying to immerse myself in things I find fun and interesting but it's not enough to deal with the loneliness. Hobbies like gaming and reading are fun diversions but it doesn't meet my need to be with others. It feels like I'm living out my retirement at 35.

47542,"More question, less answearI don‚Äôt really know how to start this? I guess I could just go ahead and explain my story. I‚Äôm just the average guy that tries to have a social circle that feels inviting and to surround me of people who (I think) wants the best for me. Recent events turn that feeling of security in a feeling of fear. In the space of merely 3 months my life went from a sweet dream to a tormented nightmare. It started off with this girl I met 2 years back (had a huge crush on her) she made me fall in love with her, every little bit of her. She made me realize on my person and created this thoughts that I never really tried to have. I guess I could say that she made me see the best of myself, made me think I was worth something in her eyes, like I was something special to her. Started the downfall soon after. We dated for 6 months, thought I found the right one and was gonna make the best out of this relationship. I only ended up fooling myself. She was talking to some other boys from her job and one friend (let‚Äôs call them jake and kyle) at the time I jad no idea, I started having panic attacks more frequently, I ate less, was paranoid most of the time. At one point I remember doing molly with her and we ended up having sex, I remember she told me that I was one of the most important relationship of her life. One week later she left me  and hooked up with jake, kyle and 2 other guys I presented to her. All in the span of one week. She even confessed to some of her friends that she enjoyed watching me being this low. 


I guess this is where my question start. I know that since that particular day of december my life started to shatter one piece at the time, from loosing my love, some friends, my job and a really close friend to me. I guess I made the descision that brought me here but. What is the point in all of this if you only end up at the bottom of the barrel. What categories the feeling of suicide? is it the way you look at the cara passing by? The subway coming into the station? the heights of the bridge? the sharpness of the knife? the products that lay around your house that could cause death? is it the thought of the rope? 

I just feel out of place, like if something went missing and I just lost my focus on life. I know this is not the way I usally think. But loosing the one I loved got to me at the point where i‚Äôm always under stress. I have panic attacks more and more frequently. Lost my job didn‚Äôt help to pile that was already there but damn.

151673,"Gonna delete this in the morning. I just needed a place to share my thoughts ... to someone who is there....
Since the day my best friend stopped talking to me I haven‚Äôt felt comfort or true happiness. Loneliness is my new normal. Every day hurts. I thought things get better with time; but I was wrong. 

I put everything I had to give into our friendship and I wasn‚Äôt good enough. The thoughts .... they have me second guessing why I‚Äôm even here. It‚Äôs just too painful. Deep down... I love her more than anything else in the world and she‚Äôs gone. She brought joy and purpose into my life again even by just having random conversations. Our emotional connection was unlike no other. But it got too tough for her. I felt I was wanted. I was needed. I was loved...

Everything I do I get reminded of her. I cannot watch YouTube to distract myself because all I can think about is sharing videos with her. I am stuck in my own mind and I‚Äôm not sure how much more I can take of this torture. 

I am trying my best to honor her wishes of us not talking anymore; and it‚Äôs the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever gone through. I put my trust in her and it became too much. Even if I were able to say ‚Äúhi‚Äù and saw that she read it.... I likely wouldn‚Äôt be in this state of mind- not this deep at least. 

I miss her so much. Life is torturous right now, and I relied on her for her support and ability to calm me down. When my life was falling apart already... she left. The support structure we had built for each other during rough times- became one I relied too heavily upon. I can see that now; but it doesn‚Äôt stop all the pain I feel on a constant basis.",suicide

Obviously what I am about to say is my theory and what I believe: If we were nothing before we were born, we're gonna enter that same state when we die. So who says that we won't be reborn again? If we enter the same state that we were in just before being born by dying, we will just repeat. Over and over. I find that terrifying, that we will be reborn, over and over, no ending, and not remember a single life that we had before, and if we won't remember this life, or any other future life that we will have, there is literally no point at all in living. But since I will just be reborn into a new life and forget what I just realized it would be unnecessary to end my life because then I would trap myself again, and then I would need to re-realize this in my next life and so on.

My point is, I'm so incredible depressed, I really really want to die, but there's no point because in my theory, I will just continue to be reborn, reborn, reborn forever and will not remember a single life that I've had.

I have no idea what to do, I feel like we're all so incredible worthless and there's no escape. I've been depressed before, and suicidal, but then I had a reason that could be fixed, this, is literally a trap that we can't escape. I don't know how to cope with life anymore.",suicide

I will almost never initiate a conversation with someone, but if they talk to me, I'll talk to them for as long as they want, so this is hard for me.

I don't know what it is, probably just a combination of things. Been depressed since probably 16 or 17. Bad use of drugs put me into a psychotic state a couple years ago, that definitely didn't help with my depression. Left me with some sort of drug PTSD or something. There will be times when my mind just snaps back to that state of paranoia, and delusions. I don't know what I have, I don't know if I'm imagining shit to help cope with what happened when I was on the drugs. A couple nights ago, my brain kept working against me. I don't know whether to call them voices or what, but my head wouldn't stop bringing up how pathetic I was. And then my mind sank back into the delusion state, and it Kept telling me how wrong everything was. As i tossed and turned in my bed hoping for it to stop, I lost it. Started screaming for it to stop, if it wouldn't go away on it's own maybe I could make it. Hit my head off the wall a couple times, and fell down crying. It stopped... but I couldn't stop thinking about what happened. How i was slowly descending into insanity. 

It's extremely hard for me to open up to people... Mainly because I'm scared of being insane. I was in a psych ward before... I don't want to go back. 

I've seen a psychiatrist, I'm on meds for depression, I'm talking to a social worker (thanks Canadian healthcare). None of it is working. I still feel like crap everyday I wake up. I have no will to change, I have no will to work on myself, I have no will to do much of anything. Whats weird is when my friend comes over, I get happy, and want to hang out with him... like it's the last time it will happen.

Nobody knows about my delusions, I don't want to talk to anyone about it, I don't want to talk to my psychiatrist about it. Being depressed is bad enough, adding in some psychotic state, with the medication that comes with it? No thanks.

I'm falling into the same patterns as last time... staying up until I can't anymore... Watching movies, playing video games, going out late at night when I'm in my worst state, buying snacks. Like I think maybe if I just shower myself with the best things I can think of I'll find a reason not to do it. The only reason I haven't done it is because I haven't worked up the balls to. The last time, I had to try to get someone to do it for me. I guess I knew there was a chance it would fail... Told myself let's try it, if it happens, It won't matter then, mission accomplished, If it doesn't, You can always try again. 

Like what is the point of this totally meaningless existence? There is none. If we were all gone, all the Humans on this planet, The world would actually be in a BETTER state. 

Is life really this: Get a job, make money, make money to purchase food. Rinse and repeat. Just so you can continue on to live your meaningless existence. Fall in love, marry her, Why? Because your brain tells you she's wonderful, beautiful, attractive, why? You must procreate. You must contribute to the human hives existence. Now you have someone to share your meaningless existence with. Have kids, so they can grow up and do exactly as you did... contribute to the meaningless existence.

Bliss... Eternal Bliss... that's what I imagine when being dead. Call it heaven if you're the religious (cult) type, I don't care. Not having to worry about things, not having to think about things, not having to think. Just emptiness. Uninterrupted Emptiness.

i'm a no one. been alone all my life. treated like an outcast by family because i'm the only one standing out. i'm a failure, i stutter, bad academics and some things i don't tell anyone...but willing to share here because i have nothing to lose.

i'm a pathetic useless 19 year old that cannot talk to people. when meeting people its almost impossible to even get my name out.

backstory, how i got my stutter, years back. stayed with my uncle..he sexually abused me for a year.. i started feeling insecure, my cries for help everyday by him started hitching till i developed a stutter and over the years of school..got bullied alot. beaten up..stutter worsened. i had hobbies that kept me on the straight path but it didnt last. stutter worsened. affected my marks in school. met my uncle years later and same thing happened again. please...dont get any thoughts...it was painful.

i lost all kinds of confidence. my father always complained im the opposite of him. his fit. sporty person. me: a indoor weak person with no sense of ambition of the future. by the way, i told my parents about my abuse when i stayed with my uncle (that time my parents were out of the country) and they didn't seem concerned..

I've started doing drugs..weed was regular, tried mushrooms...high dosages (cried everytime on doses over 5grams...looking at all my flaws) I tried ecstacy (alone with music through a speaker, because i'm insecure about parties and i have no friends) done coke, codiene (not reAlly a drug) but nothing could help me find myself. i tried overdosing but it just made me more insecure. Its so painful...

i tried cutting myself afew times..bled out once, blanked out but didnt die...

theres so much more to my life but its going to be rambling. im sorry for the long text... im sorry if i bore anyone. i'll stop complaining. have a good day",suicide
29065,"Middle of my First Year of CollegeI am here because I don't know how to handle the anxiety anymore. I just got out of my first exam of the term, and feel pretty in the dumps. Started studying for my math exam tomorrow, and realize I don't know anything about what they are testing me. 

Problem is that I know I have been putting in tremendous effort so far and I have been maintaining A/Bs in all my classes. 

This contrast of confidence has gotten me really put down. I can't shake the feeling that I have forgotten to learn since high school. In either 2 years or until I get a stable job, my parents are paying for my college tuition and classes. It drives my emotions to the ground knowing that I am going to end up disappointing them. 

I really feel like there is only two ways out, one with death and the other with the disappointment of my entire family. I can't disappoint them, I do not know what to do.

I feel like such a hypocrite and a disgrace, my father did everything for me. He put me through private school and university. What I did was I dropped out, nobody knows. My dad thinks I should be graduating this summer. I even took the money back from school and I didn‚Äôt spend it on drugs or anything, I don‚Äôt do drugs. I just spent over $30k on random shit to be honest. 
I feel horrible, I can‚Äôt keep going with the lie anymore.

I love him so much, and I‚Äôd rather die than see him disappointed. He didn‚Äôt do anything wrong and I don‚Äôt want him to feel like he did. My heart hurts typing this. I‚Äôm so disappointed in myself. Why did I do this? I don‚Äôt know. I break up with every nice guy that tries to date me, cause I feel scared if they found out how fucked up I am they‚Äôre gonna leave me. So I turn into an absolute cunt.

169648,"Alone in a full houseHi everyone. My first ever post on reddit and it‚Äôs to a suicide page. I‚Äôm 27 on the verge on committing suicidal yet again. I used to be proud to say at 14 I was a survivor of suicide, but now at 27 I hope I never have to say those words ever again. Two nights ago I called the suicide hotline and since then I‚Äôve been writing my letters and getting my business in order. I need help. I‚Äôm not strong enough to ask for help in person so this is my next best thing. Long story short my therapist and the person on the suicide hotline told me I need to find the small things in life to live for. I stupidly lived on for my 3 younger sisters. At 14 I vowed I would never hurt or leave my sisters this way, never again. Now that we‚Äôre all older, we‚Äôre all grown individuals who need to be loved and cared for in different ways. With Covid I‚Äôm back at my parents and feel like a loser in my own home. So left out. There is a lot more that led me to wanting to kill my self, but that‚Äôs beside the point. I solely lived for my little sisters and now that we‚Äôre no longer close let alone them rarely speaking to me, it feels like the ultimate betrayal. 
I need help finding the little things to live for. 
Guys, I‚Äôm back at my parents place, no car, no pets, single as hell, already graduated, no kids. What in God‚Äôs name will keep me from killing myself. I understand I should be able to find the little things in life, but for the past two days I cannot. The first day I didn‚Äôt kill myself was because my little cousin picked up, well I did try, but it didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm not killing myself today I want to die in the family house. I want to leave them with a few hours with them just thinking everything is okay. I‚Äôm so sorry",suicide

I'm dead

They won't have to deal with me

I'm out of their minds forever

I won't have another chance to mess something up again

I won't have another chance to hurt people

My parents won't have to pay so much for therapy and meds

They'll only have one child (the one that isn't defective)

I can finally have some peace for once

Maybe she won't hate me as much anymore

I'm not going to be able to have more relationships with other people even if I am alive so what's the point

I can choose how I go out (yay personalization)

If there is a hell, I deserve it anyway

150376,"So I'm out of the hospital and I want to kill myself.Let me begin by saying I'm a fucking loser. For some reason I decided to take one year off uni last year and it ended disastrously, I left everything I had friends, and an education behind to live in a small town with my family. I became so isolated and it let to a psychotic break that landed me in the hospital.

Now I am out and have been for several weeks. I'm also attending the same university (faculty in Serbian parlance) studying the same thing - Sociology.

And it's kicking my ass. My knowledge is not fresh, I forgot stuff. To top that off because of my hospital stay I was three weeks late to the classes so there's catching up to do and tests are very soon. But that's not all! My faculty is currently under siege by students who are unsatisfied with how things are run and there's no classes going on right now. So I tend to just go to uni regardless and study in the library.

The reason I want to kill myself is that I don't see a bright future for myself. I won't do well in school, because of my knowledge being stale and because I am on diazepam (3 times a day 5mg) and tradozone (a sleeping aid/antidepressant) and my mind just doesn't feel sharp enough. And coming late to a group of people who I attend classes with who all know each other for a year and I don't even know their names... that's another thing. My social anxiety/awkwardness returned in full swing and I find it hard to approach anyone. Luckily there's people I know around... but they are just acquaintances and we don't hang out.

I only have three friends who I assume only hang out with me out of pity. 

I am very depressed and often unwashed. I probably stink badly because I haven't showered in days.

It's just looking at all those people younger than me, better looking than me, fresher than me, smarter and better at studying... I just don't feel like I belong. I don't feel like I'm accepted anywhere and I feel like I never will be. I feel as isolated studying in the big city as I was in the small town.

Granted because of the siege thing I only got to go to a few classes and I know I should probably give it more time but I feel like it's all pointless and like my life is empty.

Just a few more details, my parents pay for my education and I don't live on campus (the way it works here you have to be on a state scholarship to be accepted into dorms). They haven't been pressuring me to achieve anything. Everyone around me, including my doctors acts like this is a test run. That I should just be happy my delusions stopped and I'm out of the hospital.

I also go to this support group and the people there are all older than me and they are all more seriously ill than me, they feel happy that they're alive and they spend their days monotonously and they're encouraged. The idea behind that, and what they are making me do by keeping a tight schedule (meant to include stuff like folding the sheets in the morning but fuck that) is to keep myself as calm as I was in the hospital which I really feel is bunk.  Don't tell me to quit it because I can't, my parents wouldn't let me. And I think it helps in a way, at least it's something to do on Tuesdays.

But right now I really want to kill myself. Sorry this got so rambling. If you got to the end I guess what I really wanted was some attention and maybe someone to talk to, I don't want to push away the few friends I have by complaining to them incessantly.

TL;DR I'm terribly depressed and want to kill myself three weeks after getting out of the hospital where I was treated for psychosis.",suicide

I would say my suicidal thoughts are rooted in two things: my constant disappointments with my grades in school and my ex-girlfriend.  

I'm a computer science student but whenever I try to study programming, I often don't understand something and it just eats me alive. When I look at the assignments I have to complete, I just feel overwhelmed and hopeless looking at them. I had to drop a Calculus class which was just another added disappointment. Even more, since I dropped it, I have more idle time which means more suicidal thoughts.

I broke up with my girlfriend more than a year ago. She has a new boyfriend and it kills me to see pictures of them together. I do my best to avoid her social media but I can't help but bring myself to it. Knowing she doesn't give two shits about me anymore makes me feel worthless and I ruminate all day with thoughts of her. I know there are other fish in the sea, but I can't see myself meeting someone new in the near future which is also very depressing.  

I've been on several different medications. Prozac, Wellbutrin, and more recently I was prescribed Lexapro a few days ago. I'm not very hopeful with antidepressants anymore but I have a little bit of hope for Lexapro.  

I have no motivation. No desire to see what will happen in the future. My life is just full of disappointments, one after another. Ever since I was young (elementary/junior hs) I always just feel as though I've always been a sad person. I'm fearful that my time is running out. Help.",suicide

213277,"The entire declaration of Independence The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

I can no longer drive, I can't work and I don't have the strength I once had, even walking can be a struggle. Not only that but, Women run away as fast as they meet me, and I am way too weird, I just don't know how to turn it off. I have no social life anymore and was forced to move in with my mother. I don't go on dates anymore because I feel like I'm Catfishing. The reason I say that is because, when I go on a date, at the end of the date women will ask where I parked and I end up telling them the truth, that I can't drive and my Mom dropped me off. 10% of the women I date seem cool with it, the other 90% say, thanks for dinner, give me a hug and I never hear from them again. I hate living like this, I hate feeling so alone, I hate being unable to do the things someone my age would do, and I hate waking up knowing that nothing is going to change. I'm 30 years old and I have no future, I have no income, and I know there isn't a women in this world that would want me. I honestly feel like Ron in Harry Potter in this scene https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDd4UNPIb0o except for what Hermione says about Ron is what the truth is for me. There isn't a women in the world who would want to deal with someone like me, and that okay because I don't want to hurt anyone, or become a burden to anyone else and that seems like all I can do these days.

All my friends are spread out across the country and I don't feel very close to them emotionally (skype and such but it doesn't feel the same). I feel extremely lonely. I can hardly remember any instances where I was truly happy in life. I'm graduating college top 10% of my class probably but will most likely not find a decent job.

I feel like I've been stumbling through life since I was a child. I've never really done anything, other than read the occasional book or play a few video games. I've never been able to really focus and complete any of the MANY projects I've started over the years. I get excited with an idea, filled with passion, and then it never goes anywhere.

Friendships and relationships just don't seem to work. I've screwed up with every group of friends I've ever had, and not in some momentous crazy way; they just didn't like me. Every time I would come to a place where I realized this and then I just felt terrible about it. About myself and about the fact that it seems like I just don't have the ability to be a normal human being.

I've smoked pot and that quickly became a vice, although now that I'm out of money the habit has died quickly. My family is angry at me for screwing up, doing poorly in school and just plain doing nothing with my life.

I'm 21 and I've done literally nothing. Why can't I do this? I don't really have any answers...

185405,"reoccurring dreamI keep having reoccurring dreams of something that happened to me as a child. It was a summer day, and I was over my cousin's house sitting by their 6 foot deep pool. I was about 5 or 6, and I remember sitting on the edge of the pool kicking my feet in the water. Then suddenly I was in the middle of the liquid death.

Now I don't remember how I fell into this pool of water but I do remember screaming for help, and my younger cousin could only watch in horror. Where was the adults at? I remember after a couple seconds of trying to stay afloat I gotten tired and I stopped screaming because my lungs was being filled with water. I don't know how long it was, but i remember just accepting what it was. As a kid, I did not know what death was. There was a strange comfort of just letting go. I stared up and though I couldn't see with chlorine water burning my eyes, I will never forget how bright the sun was and how quickly everything turned black. 

Obviously I didn't drown, but I did have to be resuscitated. A older cousin (whom I'm not close to now) apparently dove in the water and saved me.  

But in my reoccurring dream I was never saved. I stayed in darkness. Only to sink deeper and deeper. At first I considered it a nightmare, because I kept struggling to stay afloat. I kept fighting with every ounce of my will to scream and scream with no one around to hear me. Sometimes in my reoccurring dream there is people that I know in my life. They surround the pool of water and they watch this small child struggle to stay afloat. Maybe this is my personal hell? I do not know.

Whenever my body finally gives up on me I sink into the liquid as it envelopes my lungs. It becomes the opposite of chaos and noise. There's a peace in accepting what is happening to me. From that point on, it becomes a normal night's rest and the once nightmare is now a calming dream. 

I have to accept that I'm drowning.

I'm not sure why, what started this or why it's got worse. I just can't seem to dea lwith anything. I finally got the courage to phone my brother on xmas day in tears, he has dealt with shit like this before himself. He dragged me to the doctors and all they cared about was putting me on tablets. I tried it, they doubled my dosage... then they never gave me more tablets. 

I don't know what to do, I can't stop crying at random times. I feel so stupid for it, there is nothing to cause it. It got bad enough that I couldn't go into work one day, and I never went back. I got fired for not turning up. I've sold everything of value just to keep a roof over my head, but I have nothing left. Nothing in my head is making sense. 

I go through periods where if I focus on something, I can make it a few hours without anything, but if ANYTHING happens negativly, the longer I left it the worse it gets. I've recently started cutting into my knees deeply, then punching my legs hard enough to squirt the blood out. Noone knows about this. 

I live ""alone"", well I rent a room in a house, with an elderly lady, and a middle aged man. I hardly see either of them and I prefer it that way. I hate going outside nowadays. People annoy me, and I shake a lot when I do push myself to head down the shops. It's got to the point where my phone charger broke, and I'm glad. Glad because I no longer have to use my phone. I can't be called about anything. 

I know it's stupid, I know it's causing me more problems. The police kept trying to ring me because yet again I fucked up, and was caught speeding on my motorbike. I have a court fine to pay, but I've ignored it. I now can no longer pay it either. This is not a plea for money, I want help not charity. I had to sell my bike to pay off rental arrears. Since selling it I've started thinking how easy it would of been to ride at 100+ into a truck or something.

I'm sitting here typing this crap, tears pouring away, and I just keep looking at the blade wishing I had the fucking guts. I can only do superficial shit before I puss out. Can't even end it properly huh?

I hardly eat, I've started to enioy the stomach pains. I love food don't get me wrong, but if I don't eat it doesn't cost me, and I don't need to head outside. I'm not fat, or skinny. It just helps not to eat right now. I've stopped doing pretty much everything. I play the PC a lot, because I find it helps take my mind off of things. otherwise I sleep all night and day. I literally spend 80% of my time either in bed crying or asleep. And there is no fucking reason for it.

I've got noone to turn to, noone understands what I'm going through cause not even I do. I'm single, alone, Mothers dead, wish my father was dead and if I ever see him he will be( I was born as the result of a gang rape, where my ""father"" forced the other 19 guys to wear a condom, while he did not). I have my aunt, but she does not understand this at all. After xmas and my brother taking me to the docs for tablets, she kept telling me to just cheer up and do things... I fucking can't just do that. I wish I could, I wish there was some magic pill or thought I could have.. 

I'm finding negativity in everything these days. For example I found an old pair of really good headphones, thought I might enjoy some music.. but after an hour of fairly quiet use the left speaker blew causing me a fair bit of pain in my ear. Ironic right, complaining about pain? 

I'm so tired of this. I'm stressed out to fuck, doing nothing about it because the stress has caused some shit in my brain to not work. I was on tablets, but had to stop them instantly, I ran out, I finally got the balls to go to the doctors for some more on the last day of having any, and got told they couldn't get another prescription for me for 2 days. Bullshit, just sign the fucking paper and let me have the SAME tablets I had last time. But no stupid woman behind the desk would not let me see a doctor as it wasn't an emergency. It was. To me...  I keep sweating majorly, shaking like mad uncontrolled, crying for no reason. I don't see anything changing, I have things piling up around me and deadlines coming up and passing and nothing is happening or changing and I'm going to run out of time. I just can't take this anymore. ",suicide
185831,"I freaked out again and now my heart wants me to end it allI just recently had an argument with my partner. It only ended because he wanted to sleep.

I freaked out because we had to reschedule meeting up today, but after I found out he hung out with someone else (a mutual friend), I felt jealous and lied to. I ended up telling him in an irrational voice how much I felt like I was ditched. He tried explaining things to me but I didn't listen. Instead I felt like he was invalidating me so we kept arguing. He asked for a time out when he felt like it was getting way too intense. 

When we started talking again hours later, it was supposed to discuss what happened. I tried explaining again in a slightly less emotional tone and I still felt really upset that he didn't get me. Please don't demonise him because I thought what he said was reasonable and I knew I did freak out.

But then it escalated it further because I was expressing how much I felt exhausted by me escalating things and making arguments extremely emotionally intense than they should be. I then suggested, but not outright say it, that perhaps we should break up because it was obvious that I was causing way too much stress for both of us. He then said he wanted to sleep because he was feeling sick from all the stress and that he'd talk to me tomorrow night.

Frankly, I'm scared that he'd agree with me and thus end the relationship. I recently dropped out of university due to my poor mental health, I have an unstable job, I have lost my whole sense self given that I feel like university drained my whole lif out of me. Right now I feel like he's all I have and I just pushed him away. He'd keep me sane and give me the strength to work on myself, but now I feel like I just pushed my source of strength away. I'm going through therapy, but I'm obviously still unstable. 

Now I feel like everything's about to end and every part of my being except the part that controls my physical actions wants me to just skip the pain and just kill myself already. I've been a mess for a long time now after all, and maybe this is my sign. I could call the local suicide hotline right now but I don't want to make a scene. I feel like a burden enough already.

These were all things I thought were in my control. I just hadn't figured out exactly what the issue was. But, now I'm told that there's nothing I can do about it. I have an issue, but it's still being researched. 

I think the worst part of this is that it puts an undue burden on others, especially my wife. I've been a shitty-ass husband. I've been a shitty-ass son, a shitty friend, and my biggest fear is I'll be a shitty father to my boys.

What the fuck am I to do? If I realized 5 years ago that I had there was an non-treatable and incurable condition that would keep me like this and would probably get worse with age, I never would've gotten married. My wife deserves better than that.

So, now I think....if something were to happen to me, it's actually not the worst thing that can happen for me or for my family.

Yeah, I get it. It would be tough for my kids. And I think about how difficult it would be without a dad. But, I also can't decide which is worse: no dad, or a shitty dad. At least I couldn't fuck up their lives.

I try to be better. Try to do what I should. Try to be successful and be a good husband and a good person, in general. But every fucking attempt is failure in one form or another.

I'm just tired. And I'm tired of all this shit and I'm tired of being a disappointment and knowing my wife regrets being with me.

I'm ready for death. I won't go looking for it, but I can't help but think that it would be better for others if I just slipped away one day.

And, yet, there's a part of me that can't give up. I can't just sit in a slump feeling sorry for myself. I will keep trying because it's who I am and what I do. I hate being called lazy. It's the worst thing, but that's what I'm called every day...all because of something that I can't control. So, I'll keep pushing myself.

This is just a vent. Something to get off my chest. My wife isn't very sympathetic. So, talking to her is a waste of time. And before anyone jumps on her, I don't blame her. If I had to put up with the bullshit she's had to for the last few years, I probably wouldn't be sympathetic, either. I've been a horrible ass, and I deserve it. 

Thanks for listening to my stupidity.

Last year i succeeded to make a group of friends (we were 3-4) sharing the same hobbies. Now that i'm back to school I can't make new friends in my class. I still see my friends from last year but it's rare. Everyone in the class know each other, which sets me apart. I also never been in a real relationship in my life (i was in one 5 years ago but it wasn't really serious), and the homework stack keeps getting bigger. I can't relax at home, because i gotta do the homework, and at school it's the same pattern: work, work, work (which is pretty normal considering it's, well, school). My parents do not trust me, i always have them checking if i properly packed my bag, if i wrote my essay with a fountain pen and with no error whatsoever; yeah, i lost trust in my parents as much as they lost theirs for me, it's really depressing. For almost a year now i've been seeking a gf but i doesn't seem to be any girl interested, which puts my mood down even more. I feel like it keeps going down, i don't feel like i have a purpose... Anyway, you get it, my life is pretty bad haha. The only thing that gets me to wake up in the morning is an instagram account i run, it's the only way i interact with the outside world. Either way, i eat alone, i learn alone, i do at least 60% of my stuff alone. I don't know what do to, and i figured Reddit would help. Don't worry, I don't plan on killing myself, but if i start to have those thoughts i'm definitely going to see a psychiatrist. Hope i can get social advice here :)

241419,"Not suicidal at the moment, just need to get this out. Not sure how to start these things. I'm 16 years old and I was diagnosed with depression about eight months ago, but the effects of depression and suicidal thinking I've been experiencing for much longer, I'd say about 2 and a half years. 

I've had suicide ""attempts"" but I view these only as testing the waters, seeing just how close I can get to death before I back out. The most recent one was the most frightening. When I do this stuff to myself an intense clarity comes over me. It is quite literally a calm before the storm: everything is crystal clear and in those moments I swear I knew the answers to the universe. I was ready to die that night, but again I backed out. Each time I get ever closer. 

Right now I'm the happiest I've been in a long time; just gotten out of hospital and I'm on new medication, making huge strides in therapy. Yet I cannot shake this feeling of utter dread. This feeling of knowledge - the simple plain fact that my time is limited and when I die, it will be by my own hand. I am my own worst enemy. It feels like trying to hold up the sky - I can fight as hard as I can but eventually, the time will come when I break and the sky crushes me. I am loved. I can see it, feel it and experience the joy that it brings. But it feels worthless. I am unable to dredge up any meaning from life. I know I should try harder in school, but I just don't - I don't see the point in it. I want to make it clear that I am very happy, content with my life how it is at the moment. But similarly to how a terminal cancer patient is enjoying their last days, I enjoy my last days with those that I love. I know that people will be hurt - my family, friends, girlfriend will be absolutely crushed. But I feel like its not up for me to decide - the darkness within me is too powerful. It is relentless and I am its prisoner. ",suicide

I had to move back in with my parents who I can't stand; they're actually alright people but they have undiagnosed mental health issues and my dad thinks my depression and anxiety is a bunch of bullshit and that I use it as an excuse to be lazy. They're retired and have very little money, and I'm a huge financial burden on them. 

I am lazy as shit. I cant even put my clothes away, my room and my previous apartment are fucking messes. I'd rather lie down and stare at the wall. 

I have a fuckbuddy who I have feelings for, but I know he doesn't really care about me. He talks to me enough to keep me on the back burner so he can get his dick wet when he wants. I mean, he's actually a nice person, but he's a little younger and I've been around enough to know when someone genuinely cares about me or not. So he wants to fuck, and I oblige, because I have very few people I can talk to and at least I can have some real human contact when I'm with him. 

I can't afford to move out, because my shitty retail job only gives me 25 hours a week and even if I were to land an interview doing something worthwhile, I'd probably end up skipping it or fuck up badly during it. I just don't care about myself. I want to care about myself. But I don't. 

I want to die but I'm too chicken shit. Scared of plunging into eternal oblivion. Scared of the pain. Kinda feel guilty about how it would affect my parents, and my sister and a couple of my ""friends"" I guess. I don't know.

Over and over I've found myself wishing I could ""just give up,"" but when I started to try to think through what giving up means, and what giving up looks like, I couldn't really come up with anything.

My suicidal tendencies are definitely on the passive end of the spectrum--I don't really want to kill myself so much as I sometimes think that I want to die or already be dead or never have been born or get some sort of magic do-over in life.

I think this is why my brain sometimes gravitates toward the idea of just giving up but like... how does one give up? At bare minimum the bills must be paid somehow. What would giving up actually entail, short of dying?

""So, if the apple *has* to fall, the most important question in my mind is what happens to it upon hitting the ground? Does it touch down with barely a scratch? Or does it smash on impact?

One of these nights I won‚Äôt only load one or two in the revolver. I will fully load it to take away the chances. I‚Äôm so fucking tired of this pain. 

Everything I‚Äôve suffered: being raped by a family member. Two girlfriends being murdered at different points in my life. A boyfriend killing himself. Years of drug addiction and alcoholism and homelessness.

Haven‚Äôt I suffered enough? I can‚Äôt even laugh at the joke that is God. Why would I believe? What kind of god lets a kid get fucking raped? 

I want it to stop. Please take my pain away. If something would cause my death sooner rather than later, that would be fine with me. Just make the pain stop. I can‚Äôt live like this.",suicide

So at the beginning of the year I tried to kill myself through overdosing on sleeping pills, didn't work but I slept great for the first time in months, and after that everything has gone down hill from there. For example my girlfriend left me, I came out of the closet to my parents about being transgender and was told by my father that I'm an idiot and wrong, I started cutting worse than ever before and finally to top it all off my best friend has fallen in love with me. I feel guilty about everything and it's been eating away at me, I feel like I just hurt everyone around me with the way I treat myself. I feel like I'm falling apart and it just keeps getting worse and worse with each breath I take. I want it to end and I'm so close to doing just that.",suicide
165735,"I can't even cryI really hope someone's reading all of this. English isn't my first language and I'm writing this on my phone.

I've never thought that I'd arrive at a point this low in my life. I'm male, 16 years young, have the feeling to be at the edge of dropping out of highschool and abused the love and trust of my parents to the point that I doubt I can regain it ever again. 

Let me tell you something about me:
My roots are from Syria, I've been there a couple of times, but I was born and am living in Austria right now. My parents try to carry on the arabic traditions from home and they also bring the mentality with it. Back when my parents decided to live out in Austria it was a dream come true. My dad had to do repeat his studied in electrical engineering in german and finally got his diploma. After some tough years my mother found a good paying job in the Austrian UNO. The first years were very rough (financially) for my parents. After some time the situation became stable and we moved to a much bigger appartement. My father never found a consistent job.
I have the most loving parents you could imagine. I'm spoiled, I have food,money,a room, my own pc, everything i could imagine. 

Now you know where I come from

I always was an avarage student, liked from both teacher and students, I've never had any problems, I have friends and I don't know anyone who really dislikes me in any way.
I'm good with computers and play sports regularly. 
The last weeks I got into partying with my friends, since I'm not allowed (by my religion) to drink and there never was any group pressure forcing me to drink or smoke. They offered me to drink/smoke with them, I refused  and they accepted and respected it without a problem. 

Nevertheless I'm quite introverted and think very often about various things. I think I'm a bit anxious but I wouldn't say I'm depressed. Like every other person I think about suicide as a topic, like just thinking about it, what would happen IF I wasn't here, how would things change etc. But I would never ever even think about commiting it. There is absolutely no reason to and I would pretty much miss quiet some things in the future. 
I am excited for the future, but I am incredibly scared.

I've been skipping school a few times,because it's boring as hell, my grades are getting worse and worse and teachers are starting calling my dad. I DON'T WANT to skip school, I HAVE NO IDEA why I'm doing it. My actions are absolutely irrational which is very uncommon for me. I'm shifting into depressed thoughts and how I am not capable of handling my life at all. I feel incredibly empty inside. I didn't write an assignement which was due to christmas because I was to lazy doing it. My geography teacher is ruining my chances of doing well at her subject in unethical ways were even the teachers. My parents are incredibly disappointed and I have broke their trust so many times by lying to them about my grades, because I exactly know where they are coming from and that they know that I know that I don't have any excuse not doing well in school.

My dad is getting old now amd he still hasn't found a job after 15 years as an ELECTRICAL ENGINEER he had to do his studies 2 times in Syria and in Austria and he is still not getting any job. He is too proud to work in a job which isn't in his field. My dad is incredibly depressed about this topic and all he does now is looking up to me and my brother, so that we do well in school and end up getting a job and taking care of him.

I don't know what the issue is with me, I can follow the teacher easily in class, but when it comes to studying, doing homework or sitting at an exam I totally fail. I'm planning on graduating next year so I really need to find a way to succeed and keep myself above the water. I'm failing at 3-4 subjects right now and I just really don't know what to do. I definitely  don't want to repeat the year nor I want to change school, it's just not an option for me and my parents have enough weigh to carry.

I am a manipulative asshole to my parents and I really dont want to be that kind of person. Everyone knows me as the smart nice lovely guy without problems and it really fucks me mentally up that i am not the person I want to be which everyone thinks I am.

My dad confronted me today after I skipped school because of this german assignement, I told him everything I just told you and how i can't handle stuff, it broke my fathers heart, he is thinking that I'm lying or he isn't sure and I just wanted to break down in tears. I couldn't. I didn't feeI/think anything. I have never been so sad like I was today, yet I can't cry. 
Something fucked me up.
I want to change.
I want my family to love and trust me like they used to.
I want to make my father proud.
I want to graduate.
I want to be happy again
Please help me.

I couldn‚Äôt decide between nursing and medical school. Wanted to do nursing since it‚Äôs much easier and less time consuming than medical. Currently an LPN thanks to trade school. went to college and majored in biology since my Christian mother was all like ‚ÄúGod said you‚Äôre a neurosurgeon‚Äù after I asked her to inquire about my ‚Äúcalling‚Äù since he  likes her enough to reply.

As my luck would have it, college is absolute shit. I hate chemistry and all the math classes I have to take. I hate my major, the school, the teachers. I don‚Äôt want to sit for for a 7+ hour MCAT (it‚Äôs like SAT on crack + bio, biochem, physics etc) I barely made it through trade school and somehow passed the NCLEX. College is kicking my ass, so what makes me think I can go to and graduate from medschool. 

I lost my lab internship at a renowned due to my &lt;3.0 GPA. I had a break to ‚Äúget my grades up‚Äù,  but it‚Äôs so much worse this round, I might just ghost them when they ask ‚Äúhow‚Äôs it going‚Äù

I went to the dean today to drop a fucking trig class. YES TRIG. Fuck I‚Äôm such a dumbass. school calendar posted online was absolutely fucked. The dean told me that it was wrong and I should have referred to a SLIP of PAPER given at orientation. ORIENTATION FOR THE SPRING TERM. I‚Äôm not a transfer, so why the hell would I go to Spring Orientation. They didn‚Äôt even announce that. 

I managed to gather three consistent mentors through out the years. An MD-PHD I met in middle school, a pediatric ICU doctor who I met through a teacher, and a medical student I met through the aforementioned internship. I‚Äôm letting them all down. 

My mom won‚Äôt shut up about how I‚Äôm a nurse in college going on to medical school. I haven‚Äôt been accepted to anything. I‚Äôm failing math and barely passing chem. I ain‚Äôt shit.

Everything about socializing pisses me off because I'm so bad at it, but it's too necessary, and I hate being alone. I hate being with people but then I feel like my life sucks because I have no friends or connections and I will NEVER have either of those things. I just don't give a fuck. This shit makes me so angry that I just wish the worst kinds of emotional pain on other people in general. I want my family to be hurt, even though they did nothing wrong besides not give a shit about me. I never felt loved by my fucking family and I don't give a fuck how much any of them actually do love me, they fucking suck at showing it, which I guess circle back to how I turned out this fucking way. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I'm completely enraged by my existence. They have plenty of fucking letters to read when I'm done.

when i was 13/14, cant remeber, my sister caught me watching porn and i became really embarassed at how it played out, i couldnt talk to girls until i went to therapy like 2 years ago.

I haven't had any life expereinces, no money, can't go on holiday.

No job experience, no education... everyone i knew in school have moved on, i have no friends. I don't talk to people in my school.

Feel like i have to constantly catch up. 

hate living with family at home.

I'm not suicidal but... there's just  a long terrible road ahead and i dont look forward to it.

Nothing is going to bring me any relief or happiness.

Sucks being unemployed.

I try to combat these thoughts by exercising regularly, cut down on sugar and salt a bit, sleep well, wake up early...but i have no purpose in life. Sometimes i just have sit in silence.

There's too much i want to do, so little time, i have to focus some time into fidning a job, but my mind isn;t there. The only jobi can get is a retail job, i dont wanna talk to people in my current state of mind.

I wanna be around people who share the same goals i do, i wanna be around people who have goals and what to be somene in life. Who have ambition... Who are a bit like me. 

I get envious of little things, feel threatened. When i see someone on instagram doing something fun, i immediately have a suicidal reaction. If i see someone doing some cool art shit, i immediately feel threatened.

At the start of my 8th grade year I started to cut myself to help deal with the verbal and physical abuse my parents cause me. Around that same time I realized i was bisexual.(I'm a boy) I was having troubles with depression and suicidal thoughts. But nothing was going that badly. Then my sister attempted suicide during winter but she survived. I lost it the only person that cared about me was 50 miles away and I couldn't even talk to her. So 1 month later I attempted to hang myself. I kicked the chair but had a knife in my hand so I cut the rope. All I remember was that I threw away the rope and told myself I would never do that again. 1 year later I'm here. 3 weeks ago my dad beat me and then left our family. The friends I have at the time are helping me get through this but I've complexly snapped. Today My mom told me that my father was coming back by the end of the month and said she didn't care if he beat me again. I'm thinking about killing myself because I don't want to destroy my family any longer and I know that my death will cause a lot of sadness amongst my friends especially since I'm bi and another friend of mine is bi I was hoping if I dated him he would bring some happiness into our lives but I know that will never happen.

75691,"Suicidal after a miscarriageThis is going to be long. I don't expect anyone to actually read it.

I've wanted to be a mother my entire life. It's the only thing I have consistently wanted. When I was 22 I found myself in an abusive relationship. There was lots of sexual abuse and a year into the relationship I was pregnant. This served as a gigantic wake up call so I left the relationship, had an abortion, and went back to school. Having the abortion was a very difficult thing to do but given the state of my life at that point I knew it was for the best. I struggled with the after effects for almost a year before feeling like myself again. 

Five years later I finally met someone I wanted a relationship with. He was kind, patient, and so laid back. Three months in to our relationship I was pregnant, despite using contraception. Together we discussed our options and, due to our respective abysmal financial situations, I very reluctantly had another abortion. But I asked him to promise me that from that moment on we'd start working towards building a life and having a family. His response was, ""I promise. Our family will be beautiful."" 

True to his word, that man is now my husband and our financial situation has vastly improved. And as soon as we got married we began trying to make a baby on purpose. But nothing happened. For an entire year. Now, since I knew full well I could get pregnant I found this to be incredibly painful. Eventually I had to stop trying because I was going crazy. So we stopped and I decided to focus on something else: weight loss.

I've struggled with my weight since puberty. I've tried everything from therapy to fad diets to an eating disorder rehab. Any weight loss I achieved was always minimal and short lived. So I decided to look into weight loss surgery. I talked to my doctor and he told me that I'd need to wait 18 months after surgery to try for a baby. I thought about it long and hard and, as sad as it made me to wait that long, I decided to go ahead with the surgery.

I had surgery in March of this year. So far I've lost 120lbs with only about 75 left to go. But in July, despite once again using protection, I got pregnant. I found out on August 4th. I cried and screamed and jumped for joy. I knew it was too soon after surgery but I was *not* letting this one go. No way. I would do whatever it took to have a healthy baby.

I learned I'd miscarried on September 22nd. Just three weeks earlier I'd seen the heartbeat on an ultrasound. But my baby was gone. So I had a third abortion, this time to remove a dead fetus...a wanted and wished for baby. I was and still am heartbroken. 

I had told myself I'd be sad for two days and then I'd move on but apparently that's not how this works. I can be totally fine one day and cripplingly sad the next. Yesterday my cousin announced that she's pregnant and that set me back really hard. She's not married so I wasn't expecting it at all and while I'd normally be totally stoked for her it threw me for a loop. It's only been a week and a half since the D&amp;C and I just wasn't expecting anyone close to me to have any pregnancy news. Naive, I know. 

The thing I'm having the hardest time with is the waiting. Because of the surgery I still have to wait an entire year before even trying again and the mere thought of that is killing me. I had made my peace with waiting but this unexpected pregnancy and the resulting miscarriage have changed everything. I thought my lifelong dream was finally coming true and I thought it was coming true *now*. But it's not even close enough for me to feel like I can plan for it or talk about ""when I have kids...."" I'm beyond impatient now. I feel like I'm broken and the only thing that will heal me is a baby.

There are other aspects to this too. Like, how am I supposed to be happy when/if I get pregnant again? How is it supposed to feel new and special and exciting when all I'll feel is bitter and afraid? How am I supposed to make all those phone calls to my family to tell them I'm pregnant again when this miscarriage is hanging over me? How am I supposed to get through a pregnancy without worrying that I'll miscarry again? What if I *can't* get through a pregnancy without miscarrying? What if we start trying and another year goes by with no luck? I'd like to think the weight loss helped my fertility (I was at some of my lowest weights each time I got pregnant but I still can't help but worry). What if I never become a mother? And please don't talk to me about adoption. It costs far too much for us to ever afford it, otherwise I'd be all about it and already working on it.

All of this...it might seem like nothing to other people but please believe that to me this is *everything*. And I believe that if I can't have a baby then I do not want to live. I don't know that I want to live if I have to wait a year to try again. I lay in bed last night fantasizing about ways to kill myself. I want the pain to stop. I keep running my hands from my shoulders down my arms in some semi-subconscious attempt to wipe the pain off me as though it were some physical thing wrapped around me. Honestly, that's how it feels: heavy, constant, and very very real. 

The only ways to make it stop are pregnancy or death. And only one of those is an option.",suicide

This is my first post on Reddit. I understand that i cannot be explicit in method, so I'll keep it very high level.

As a small background for you all, I've been thinking about suicide for the last 10 years (I'm in my 20's) - and i feel I've reached the point where I'm comfortable with myself to do it, while finding a suitable method to do so. The only thing that's held me back is how it would affect my loved ones. I've concluded that it won't matter to be once I'm dead. Still selfish though!

I would like to get your opinion (and perhaps some non-explicit advice) on this suicide method:

I'm thinking of ingesting illicit substances, waiting until I'm feeling disoriented, and then jumping off a bridge into water.
I believe at this point that drowning will be painless, and my mind will be in a state of limbo as this happens. It will be kind of peaceful.

This will be done during a music festival. Friends and siblings will be there, so it's a good opportunity to connect one last time with all. To say how i really feel about everyone, and to ensure their last experience with me is as positive as possible.
I will then ingest and walk away from the festival to a bridge close by.

I would like some opinions on the method (like the amount of drugs required, and if people have ever experienced something similar? Happy to answer any other questions..

One, we'll call Marie. At first, we were amazing. The best of friends. We really clicked on a lot of things, and even made plans to live in the same apartment next year. Eventually, however, it became clear that I was only a placeholder for her true goal: having a boyfriend. She told me flat out that ""you will never be as important to me. I'm here to find a person to marry."" She's a real peach, as I'm sure you can tell. She only is around when she needs something and only is able to ever talk about herself and how **horrible** her life has been. But she thinks she's a godsend, and when you're not actually needing support, she's happy to tell you she'll always be there because she's such a great and giving person.

The other girl, Aspen, got really mean one day for no reason. Turns out she was a compulsive liar and had fabricated EVERYTHING she ever said for the first few weeks. It was really bizarre. She is honestly the only person I can say that I definitely *hate*. 

Anyway, I have been dealing with some major clinical depression for a long time, but it got so much worse in the last few weeks. I have been running a mile every day and trying so hard to meet people and make new friends, but it's just not working. Friends were always really important to me, but my friendships have always ended badly. Tonight, I broke down. My roommate is gone, and I am all alone. I texted Marie and said ""Please come sit with me. I have never been so alone."" And she replied that she simply didn't want to, and plus she had some homework. It was pretty feeble, as I have the same amount of homework as her (of course, we're in the same classes) and plus, it's a Friday night. And the worst part?

A lot of things went down between me and another girl at my dance studio. She's out to get me because I got a special role in one of our dances and I'm in a dance that she's not. 

All she does is tell lies about me. I've never even done anything to her. I've only ever been nice and I thought she was my friend but I guess not. She's one of the reasons why I want to commit suicide. 

Once she told our dance group that I'd been sleeping with a bunch of boys from my school. But yet I'm still a virgin. Thankfully nobody believed her as far as I know but it still hurts. 

 She causes so much stress and anxiety in my life. She yells at me when I do something wrong but as doing as I call her out for doing something wrong she's the victim all of a sudden. I just want her to be gone already or I wanna be gone. Which everyone comes first. Maybe she realizes when I'm gone that it's blood on her hands.",suicide
295825,"This year was a very fucked up year but I learned somethings that teenagers gotta know before passing this difficult phase of life so, here is my *2021 GUIDE FOR DUMB TEENAGERS* 1- the first thing you gotta know is that you ARE alone. And you‚Äôll be alone FOREVER. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you have a girlfriend or friends, you‚Äôll still be alone forever. The only thing you need to realize is how to deal with this. Being alone is the best thing in the world and now I recognize that. Be happy with your own company.

2- grades. ‚ÄúOh, I got an A so I‚Äôm smarter then you‚Äù ‚Äúson, if you don‚Äôt get an A you‚Äôll be grounded‚Äù. That‚Äôs bullshit. Grades are just numbers based on an exam of a determined subject so THEY CANNOT MEASURE IF YOURE SMART OR NOT. You have other qualities like other people and be proud of that! It‚Äôs not a grade that‚Äôs going to tell you who you are.

3- school. Yeah guys, school is such a toxic place. Students are extremely cruel and you have to fake who you really are, otherwise you‚Äôll be bullied. The only thing I have to say is that it‚Äôs just a phase. You are in school just to study, nothing else so fuck them. Be yourself. Hatters will hate and yeah, I don‚Äôt fucking care cuz even Jesus had haters so FUCK IT. ( also, if someone is trying to copy your personality or style, just remember that every good movie has its pirated copies üòé) 


4- just LIVE. It seems difficult but it‚Äôs not. You‚Äôll fall, you‚Äôll get up, you‚Äôll cry, you‚Äôll be happy, you‚Äôll be scared and it‚Äôs normal! That‚Äôs why life is amazing. So get up from this bed and LIVE. Do wrong shit, or right shit, idc,  if you knew how quickly you‚Äôll be forgotten when you die, you wouldn‚Äôt stop doing everything you dream thinking about what others think.

107125,"I'm financially trapped and I have no support. I had dreamed of moving out of my father's house sometime soon, but I finally received the letter telling me my loans from dropping out of college were coming due. $100 a month when I only make $350-400 a month. Worse yet, they've been cutting hours from the part-timers at my store, so I'll be getting even less than that pretty soon. Adding to all this the fact that I've been heavily ""self-medicating"" with alcohol lately and that whole idea kind of flies out the window.

My father insists that the military is my only option at this point, but I really don't think it's a good idea. For strarters, the one thing I want more than anything else is to experience a loving relationship, and with a whopping 14-20% female population in military depending on the branch, combined with my social ineptitude and boring personality, it basically means that that would never happen for another 4-5 years. Additionally I've been suppressing transgender feelings for more than half a decade now and would really like to get around to addressing those at some point, and the military doesn't exactly lend you a hand for those sorts of issues.

I've been throwing around applications in hopes of finding a second job, but it took me eight months to finally find this one, so I don't really have confidence that that will work out anytime soon. I just made an appointment with a local mental health counselor earlier today to see if they can help me work through this, but it's going to be $40 a session, so it's not exactly making my financial situation better.

I had been feeling vaguely suicidal for some time now but getting that letter really pushed me over the edge. It's going to be such a long time before I have the financial freedom to do anything. More and more I just feel like there can't possibly be anything worth fighting for on the far end of this situation. It would be sparing myself so much pain if I just ended it now.",suicide

224663,"I don't know what to do. So around four years ago was when i heard my dad first mention Infowars. I wasn't on reddit or really the internet in general, so I had no idea what it was. until yesterday, I hadn't visited that website. In maybe 2018, I stumbled across the Friggin Gay Frogs remix, and asked my dad if that was the Infowars he was talking about. He told me it was and the man screaming that the frogs were gay was a genius.

 Over 2020, my dad's belief in the conspiracy theories has grown. Our family are trump supporters, and we're not all crazy. When Trump lost, me and  mom accepted defeat, and went to bed. my father, however, ranted for the next month how the democrats had stolen the election and Joe Biden was a child molester and he and all of his campaign crew should be executed. He also has very strong feelings to Bill Gates. He claims  that Bill Gates was the one who started the Covid-19 pandemic, by giving the WHO and CDC so much money they would do whatever he told them. he's also told me that Bill Gates will microchip us, and to go or do anything, we'll scan our microchip and be let through. He thinks this will happen in the next thirty years at the most. He's also not let any of us get vaccines since 2008, and yes, I am alive.

Jump to yesterday night, the 19th. My dad had been working on his truck for most of the day, and when he came in he was covered in oil or something and started washing off his hands. he then said, ""I should learn how to make soap. after all, when the apocalypse comes, we won't be able to buy it."" to that I said, ""so you really think the apocalypse will come in the next 30 years?"" he looked at me and started yelling, and I quote exactly, ""You don't understand! you don't understand! you don't understand! You just wanna sit on this goddamn couch and try and discredit all that I say! Read the books! Read the books and you'll know what I know!"" (""the books"" that he is referencing are books from Infowars, talking about how the apocalypse is coming, amongst other things. I found one book that said that Hitler didn't kill himself, he was alive today, living in Antarctica, amassing an army to attack the world for WWIII.) Anyway, He then started saying that  he'd showed me ""the evidence."" as an example, he asked me to remember when he showed me Bill Gates' patent for quantum ink dots (patent no. 60606 if you're  interested)  that turned out to be a cryptocurrency system. when I pointed that out, he slapped me across the face *in front* of my eight and ten year old siblings and threated to *throw me out of the house* if I didn't stop ""poisoning his mind"" with my ""communist talk"" he then said ""go away Satan,"" and sent me to bed.

Childhood. 

lower middle class, and I come from a korean family. 

I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety in college, had a decent childhood despite an abusive father, neglectful mother, and reckless brother. I didn't know until my dad was abusive until college actually. I always figured he took the tough love approach. What I didn't know is that when I was younger, they (brother, mom) used to lock me in a room so I wouldn't see them get beat when my dad came home in 'those' moods. 

Before they got divorced, they would fight and throw things in the house, my mother in dramatic fashion would threaten to kill herself (this is not uncommon in korean households sadly). Actually now that I think about it both her and her mother would have these violent moodswings. Anyways, my brother is half related through my mom. Him and my father never got along. He was into gangs in in cali, so we moved and he would skip school constantly. My dad beat him excessively, he ran away and sold drugs then came back after my mom literally went insane. My brother was my rock for a long time. I looked up to him. I know he was not a bad person. I mean he would buy me toys when my parents would fight, even steal them if he had to. He literally got me every transformer from beast wars (you remember the cheetah?) and every gundam he could find. He built every gundam for me cause I was scared to break them. He's twice the man I am. We don't speak anymore but I hope he knows that. 

Anyways there was one time (not sure how old I was, but I was sleeping with my dad in the spare room while mom was in the master so I must have been young) where I remember waking up and hearing her cry. Small three bedroom apartment. So I got up and saw her crying and there were pills everywhere. She was slurring and then she slumped. I woke up my dad and I remember him being pissed calling the cops then going back to sleep. They had been fighting a lot. I can't remember much that happened back then. Actually my memory is now is completely fucked. I can remember very few things that were not school related during this time. I remember some moments in elementary school, friends I met but I honestly cannot tell you what life was like in cali where I was born. Or what it was like when I was young. I don't remember anything really it kind of scares me. I actually spent my whole life feeling priveleged until I was told exactly how bad things got. It was like confirming a bad dream that you hoped didn't happen. But you realize that it did. 

So at this point, they get a divorce. But not before (hopefully timeline is correct) my mom and brother decided to break into our family dollar store and take some money to set aside just in case. Cops came, called my dad he said it was fine and I never heard about it again. Actually even before this, my mom had gotten arrested for stealing from marsh. I was there when it happened and I had to see her cry and scream while they took us upstairs and showed us the footage. Can't believe I forgot about that till now. But it's important to know for later. 

Then I remember the divorce. The courts found a house (worth a lot, at the time we had holes in our shoes. uncles would give us money.) that he had purposefully lied to my mother about owning (he gave her a fake contract to sign, basically giving her ownership of the house). Actually my dad had more than enough to support us but he was stingy or careful. I don't really know anymore. This would have been late 90s I have so many gaps in my memory I question my own sanity. Long story short, bad break up, she got half (we had two dollar stores by that time) of what he had minus the house and when the courts asked who I wanted to live with I naturally said my mom. So she got 1 store, some money, and 500$ a month for child support from my dad until I was 18. 

Fast forward a few years, she squandered what was left from the divorce (had no idea how to run a business), leased expensive cars and got a house we could not afford. We got evicted then moved into an apartment. By this time my brother got deployed to Iraq, then afghanistan a few years later. No matter how I feel towards him, I can't say I blame he acts the way he does. I'll explain later why it's important. 

Anyways, to continue. After we got a small apartment/condo she tried to start a new business selling hair pieces/wigs (Idk why the fuck she did so). I found out later she had borrowed money from a lot of people during this time which explains my earlier comment about having a decent childhood. I never went hungry. I was praised as the youngest kid in my family, and I was very good at reading/math at an early age. I was the the one that would finally graduate college, which noone in my family had achieved. So back to the store, she ended up losing that as well. By this time she was dating a lot of guys maybe to find some financial security? She was much younger than my dad when they got married so maybe she was just tired. Idk. This was around hs. I started noticing debts collection letters, and I told her that I would go live with dad to help make things easier. To be honest I was just pissed cause she would leave for weeks at a time to be with her bf (chinese dude, piece of shit). Again this is in hs. I had no idea of being locked in a room and my father being abusive. I thought he was a hardass and my mom was just irresponsible or crazy. I left after my freshman year to live with my dad and go to a better school. She called me my sophomore year to tell me she was in korea and could never come back. That she was sorry and to not believe what people said about her. I guess people weren't happy that she left and paid nobody back. I didn't speak to her until college after that call. 

When I lived with my dad in hs, He would berate me and make me feel like I could never get anywhere because I was 'lazy'. Because I didn't work 9 hours a day like he did. Ironically when I asked to get a job he said my only job was to do well in school. He would tell me things like 'youll never get anywhere like your mother' or 'you'll never go to college if you don't study'. And during this time I would smoke a lot of bud to maintain my sanity. I remember having cuts all over my arms from trying to hurt myself, I got suspended for 10 day from school for smoking before on a half day. I got kicked from NHS and basically shamed by the AP teachers that saw me as a good student. I was humiliated in my church when my pastor told everyone that I was doing drugs and needed prayers (I sang songs for the youth group and whatnot). For weeks my dad wouldn't speak to me. Leaving my mom was the biggest mistake of my life up to this point. 

You know what's fucked up though? I had 2250 on sat, 33 on act, pres. acad decathlon, over 15 AP credits. almost a perfect score on the chemistry subject test, state finalist for deca, nhs, I aced the math section on the SAT. I spent every hour of my day studying. I went through stolen previous SAT tests that my pastor had ""acquired through god"" literally would say stupid shit like that. I was still treated like shit. My dad still used to say I was lazy, or dumb cause I wanted to hang out with my friends and do normal things that teenagers do. When I lived with him I was allowed to go to two places: the church or the library. I was allowed to watch 1 movie a month with only 1 person he thought he knew, I mean why the fuck did I get constantly shit on even though I did everythign I could?

Fast forward to college. I get freedom. Start doing drugs constantly but somehow keep my GPA high cause i studied hard in hs. Eventually got to a point where I had a mental breakdown. Lost my fullride scholarship. Dropped a semester. Started selling bud to support myself. Tried to kill myself a few times. Failed miserably. Thank god I had made a lot of lifelong friends that I had helped them financially when I was flush. I was good at what I did. During my time off from school I learned about my past when my mom somehow got my number and called me. We have stayed in touch since then. She told me she was sorry and then told me what happened. I fell down and sobbed for hours. A few months later I had alienated every friend I had. Especially those that worked with me. I eventually spent the next year lost, then somehow crawled my way back through school and finished two years later with a math degree. I eventually got sick of sitting around all day. 

I taught myself to code became a jr developer at a retail company. Now I'm working for a big tech company. some days I'm happy but most times I just fell tired. When I think back on what I've experienced I feel like I'm dead. These days I don't even remember when I ate, or what projects I have to do this week. Work becomes the only distraction for me. I don't leave my room. and these days I feel content with passing away. 

I'm sure many people will think this is bullshit. Frankly I don't care. Think what you want. I have eaten yet and I've been up since 6 so idk if this makes any sense or if anyone can even follow it.

174293,"A downward spiral of self-hatred. [Long Post]Hey Reddit.

So, I understand that there's a number of posts on here. Despite that, I'll deposit my thoughts here. I've recently moved from a place of comfort to somewhere that has posed some challenges. I'm a 19 year old college student, and I'm struggling to keep everything together. I've struggled with depression for as long as I can remember, and I thought for awhile that I had defeated it. Last year, I was hospitalized because I got overly intoxicated and downed an entire bottle of Ativan.  Whether I meant to attempt suicide or not, I'm not sure. That happening is one of the reasons I moved, to try and start over. Things were going OK for awhile, I was lonely, but managed to make some friends via a club at my school. Well. I managed to mess that up. I drink to self medicate, and because well, I just like it. Well, we had a social event for the club, and afterwards, most of us went back to one member's house and drank/hung out. I drank in excess and proceeded to be a complete asshole. I was forgiven by my club, but not by myself. Some time passed from that, and que my next fuck up. One of my classmates had invited me to a party one evening, and me being bored and lonely, happily accepted the invitation. Well, again. I became overly drunk, and had to call the person I'm dating to come and pick me up. I spewed in his Jeep, and I foggily remember punching myself in the head because I had fallen. Woke up on his couch, he drove me to my car and we parted ways. I texted him apologizing, and offering to clean his vehicle and whatever else needed it. Got a reply that said things were fine. Well. Fuck. My own self deprecation messed that up, too. I hate myself so much. I hate my brain, it dips in and out of these highs and lows. I've been diagnosed with MDD in the past. I want to kill myself, because it seems that no matter what I do, I mess it up. But, there's still a small flame in me that believes I can do something with my life. I'm trying to find things as an outlet. I started training in BJJ and MMA last week. I found an old bottle of Wellbutrin, I took one tonight and I'm going to see if that helps. Honestly, I don't know what to do with myself. Besides social matters, I'm struggling with coming out to my hyper-conservative parents. They honestly shouldn't even be married, they hate eachother. But that's a completely separate issue. Thing three...I've taken on a lot of difficult classes this semester, and I'm struggling to keep up. On top of that, my mother is pressuring me to teach myself calculus. I don't have the time to with 15 fucking credit hours. 

That's all I really have to say. It's a giant wall of text, a ramble, and I'm sorry. 

TLDR; 
Multiple things bothering me:
-self medicating leads to ruining social connections
-too many credit hours
-MDD

226156,"I‚Äôm 38, and I‚Äôm over this.I am not in a good place right now, physically and mentally. Moving to Florida was a way to start over and finally focus on myself, something I haven‚Äôt done in well over a decade being in an emotionally abusive relationship. Yet since arriving six months ago, I am just being bombarded with shit bomb after shit bomb. I‚Äôve tried staying positive, but I am being weighed down. 

First of all, no job. No one is calling me back, now more than ever thanks to Covid. I am far from alone with this issue, so it‚Äôs only going to get worse. I‚Äôve applied to banks, offices, customer service positions, I even took Security Guard training but they‚Äôre not calling me back either. I‚Äôm either over qualified for the banking positions, or under qualified for the others. I never had an issue getting a job when I was in NJ/NY, mostly thanks to the best friends I ever had in my life. But now that I‚Äôm on my own and I‚Äôm being ignored, I‚Äôm starting to take it to heart. Maybe I‚Äôm not the awesome employee I always thought I was? Maybe charm and sweetness isn‚Äôt enough to land a job anymore when you‚Äôre 38? To add insult to injury, I‚Äôm starting to regret that I never finished college.

Second, I have no savings. I‚Äôm living with my mom, which I‚Äôm grateful for, so I don‚Äôt need to worry about rent or utilities. But my personal bills, cell phone payment, entertainment, not happening. I‚Äôm down to just Netflix for another two weeks. I keep doing my laundry every few days because I have no clothes anymore. Can‚Äôt treat myself to a nice meal every now and then, or even change the oil in my car. It‚Äôs making horrible sounds so it‚Äôs just sitting in the parking lot covered in bird poop. Unemployment? Still being processed. Income tax refund? There was an issue. It‚Äôs being delayed. Stimulus check? Sent to the wrong bank, it‚Äôs also delayed. No help from the powers that be, so I‚Äôm fending it alone. 

Third, I am always sick. This is getting to me most of all. I had strep a few weeks ago. Then I had a shitty night‚Äôs sleep so I had some soup with wheat noodles. Bad idea for a gluten sensitive bloke. So at this point, I can‚Äôt have dairy, gluten, sugar, fried food, or red meat because of my health issues. Taking all this medicine is killing me. Then I find that there is a weird glitter looking substance covering every surface of my room. It‚Äôs a subtle glint that you can only see with a flashlight. But it definitely sparkles, and they‚Äôre everywhere: on my sheets, my desk, my TV, my clothing, even my phone. Quick google search identified the reason: it‚Äôs fiberglass! My piece of shit mattress is a memory foam that I got on amazon years ago. Apparently they placed fiberglass inside it to make it fire proof, but over time with 220 pounds of pressure on it, the seal can eventually break. Breathing this shit can be deadly and makes you very itchy (which I have been). Honesty I don‚Äôt have a huge amount of it, so if there is a hole it‚Äôs tiny. I sealed it up best I could and hopefully it holds out for another few months. 

Fourth, I am ridiculously lonely. I have my mom, but she has her own issues. We get along better if we keep our distance. So I stay in my little bedroom 22 hours out of the day. I go for a one hour walk sometimes, and only come out to cook, clean, or eat. I don‚Äôt have any friends here yet, and making friends takes money. I‚Äôm generally an extroverted introvert. I like having the freedom to be alone when I need to or social when I want to. Not being able to interact with people has been extremely depressing, and this was even before quarantine. I joke that I‚Äôd be happy staying in playing video games all day, but it isn‚Äôt true. I love people, and not hanging out has really dragged down my energy levels. 

Fifth, I don‚Äôt do bugs. So why the fuck am I here again? I swear on the days that I‚Äôm starting to feel ok, I‚Äôll find a team of insane raspberry ants crawling around my keyboard, crawling up my fingers, walking around drunk. You need to google raspberry ants. They are crazy, fearless, and love living in technology. My PS4 and PC gaming keyboard are ruined. My room is spotless and I do not eat here, so this isn‚Äôt a dirty thing. It‚Äôs just a Florida thing. Oh and did I mention Palmetto Bugs? A pretty Floridian name for giant fucking cockroaches that fly. I‚Äôve only seen four in our apartment so far, but it‚Äôs enough for me to make sure I‚Äôm always armed with slippers. Can‚Äôt even walk barefoot in this apartment, it‚Äôs fucking ridiculous.

This is what I‚Äôm struggling with. I‚Äôm broke, jobless, lonely, sick of being sick, and constantly attacked by bugs. And I thought my biggest issue in Florida would be the heat ‚Äî nope, I actually learned to like it. 

The sad thing is that I moved here to help take care of my mom. The cold of NJ was making her feel more sick, so after being laid off and getting out of that bad relationship, I took her and moved down here. And she loves it. She‚Äôs feeling better, she‚Äôs happy. And I‚Äôm hiding all my feelings from her because I know she will sacrifice her own happiness to make me happy. I won‚Äôt do that to her. 

I‚Äôm thinking about drinking or taking up drugs just to numb the pain. I went through something similar in college. When I came out of the closet in 1999, I was shunned by my family and friends. I attempted and failed to kill myself. So I found druggie friends and did a ton of coke and ecstasy and failed out. That‚Äôs the point I‚Äôm at right now. 

Look, I know other people in the world have it WAY worse than I do. I acknowledge that, and I feel for everything they are dealing with. I am totally grateful than I‚Äôm not in danger of living out in the street or that a loved one hasn‚Äôt caught Coronavirus. It can be worse. That being said, it‚Äôs not going so great.

I wouldn‚Äôt kill myself. But I would welcome death if it came knocking on my door. I‚Äôd probably jump in his arms and beg him to take me home ‚Äî because this, this life, doesn‚Äôt feel like home. It never did. It feels like a prison, and I want out.",suicide

It‚Äôs been happening since I was 11. There‚Äôs many things that could have caused this but I don‚Äôt know what exactly it is. It‚Äôs been worse than ever this year. I‚Äôve started cutting, I‚Äôve been messing up friendships for no reason. I‚Äôm so scared and confused and I want it to stop. The only way out I feel is suicide but I don‚Äôt want to give up. Giving up is the only consistent thing I‚Äôve done in my life over the years, and by giving up now would prove my worthlessness.

It doesn‚Äôt help to know that I‚Äôm born in a world where people of this generation might not live past the age of 30 due to things past generations did. I also live in a generation where I feel I won‚Äôt be accepted for who I am or who I will be. It‚Äôs getting tiring and repetitive, having the same thoughts over and over again.

It‚Äôs great for a job from the 20th century however I think that these jobs that are more reliant on being creative and innovative conflict with our school system‚Äôs way of teaching us to sit down and follow instructions. Given, there are exceptions, as there are with anything, but I feel this is accurate for the vast majority of situations. My parents disagreed. We all got angry with each other after having a very heated ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù and I went to my room to chill for a bit before going to sleep. Next thing I know I hear a bang on my door and it is my mother who now says I can‚Äôt use my phone or my computer. Ik I‚Äôm very spoiled and I‚Äôm trying to get better, but I was not in the right mindset to comply. So I was defiant. I had yet another ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù with her until my father came back inside with the dog. He joined in and to sum it up, I wasn‚Äôt looking forward to my second semester and thought none of it would help me, and they thought that school was about teaching us life lessons and that I should have an open mind. The life lessons they suggested were how to be organized (self-taught/Internet), how to take notes (an actually good teacher in middle school, which contradicts my argument but I‚Äôm not a liar), and how to follow instructions (great for a job where that‚Äôs the focus of it, but I don‚Äôt plan on working in a field that requires that for too long). I do understand that school teaches you things. It teaches you how to memorise and repeat information. It teaches you that sometimes you can‚Äôt get out of things because you don‚Äôt enjoy doing them. Eventually, we came to the conclusion that we were just arguing and weren‚Äôt getting anywhere and that we would try again after I meet with my therapist (i meet with her on Tuesday). I guess what I am most angry about is that I feel like they treat me like a child, but expect me to act like an adult. They are my parents, and they have the right to restrict my freedoms and again I‚Äôm a spoiled piece of shit, but I guess I feel like I‚Äôm constantly getting yelled at for being wrong about a subjective matter. I would love to hear some of your opinions on this and perhaps advice on how I can be better when having these ‚Äúdiscussions.‚Äù

315717,"I'm probably getting thereTL;DR: My depression to go crippling levels after I finished university, about 2.5 years ago. Now my life is pushing me towards the edge, work to be more specific. 

I'm just tired of convincing people I'm not dumb basically. There's this one manager who keeps belittling my previous experience (basically I was an enterprise PHP engineer, now I'm an cloud java engineer, I never was a codemonkey) and its been going on for a year now almost. I even had an episode where I introduced a feature that was not yet needed and he laughed at me for overengineering things, in the end we ended up realizing we actually need it and I was right to make it. Its basically like that all the time - I go above and beyond, get laughed at and then we see that it was actually the right decision. Maybe the last part is not always, but I'm fairly sure I do pretty good engineering because my systems just work and my code is not bad. I do my best anyways, maybe I really am a shitty engineer though, who knows. 

Because I'm so depressed that there's literally nothing else in my life than work, I've started to become more depressed because of that situation at work. I've been drinking but recently got it under control. But after today I'm just not sure anymore. I'm just tired of fighting, its not healthy.

My whole life has been like that, someone picks on me all the time, but I fight back with politeness and stellar performance. It helped me in the past - i had scumbag professors in university and all I did was just again stellar work and they just stopped bullying me after they saw that I'm not a lazy idiot. Now it doesn't seem to work. 

I'm just asking myself whether I want to live this life if its gonna be like this my whole life. Its like the only things ahead of me is endless suffering and bullying. Come to think of it, maybe its what life is for most of people out there. Someone always bullies you.

41405,"Please help me. I'm going nowhere in life and I don't want to live like this. This post may not be suitable for this sub, but I posted this on r/depression and r/suicidewatch, but got no comments and didn't show up in new, so I'm posting this in a psychology related subreddit.

Note: this was copied and pasted from my journal i started writing today. English isn't my first language, so please understand some grammar mistakes. I live in an asian country with a education system that grades students relatively, and puts more pressure onto the kids. So it may be different from the us.


A certain illness seems to have consumed me. Depression, anxiety.. I can't exactly describe what is eating me up from the inside, but I feel as if a parasite is slowly eating me alive.

Today was a bad day. I feel a temporary sense of comfort whenever I say the phrase ""today was a bad day"" in my head. It feels like that all the terrible feelings I'm having is just caused by a bad day, and that tomorrow things will be better and everything will come back to place. But it isn't. All my days are bad days. Some are worse than the others.

I had a bad stomachache while I was going to school, and the bus was crowded and everyone was loud. I hate school. I hate every aspect of it. The teachers standing near the entrance checking the kids' uniforms, the posters and screens displaying pretentious videos about college admission, the chairs that are too rigid to sit, the florescent lights that are too bright and cold, the constantly shifting schedule, the teachers who don't seem to care about the students yet talk about college admission all the time and pressure kids to choose a major and a future job and plan out their whole career at 16. The kids that are too loud. Everyone is too loud. Everything is too loud.

Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be reincarnated into another person's body without my memory fully wiped. I feel like I'm living in another person's body. The only time I can feel truly myself is on the internet. I started a discord server a few days ago. Everyone was great, yet I felt miserable. I felt as if I was tricking them into thinking I was a smart and funny person. I haven't felt this in a while, and I cling onto that sense of self worth and belonging I can never get in real life. 

In real life, in school, in hagwon, it's different. I am still that star trek obsessed kid who thinks too much and tells weird jokes, but nobody knows be. Nobody knows who I am. Even my mom, my teachers, the kids in my school, nobody knows me. I can never talk about things I love in real life. I can't talk about html and building my own website with anyone, I can't talk about star trek or memes, I can't discuss philosophy or talk about how school sucks and how bad my day was. I feel like nobody gets me offline. I don't feel accepted. I feel like I'm the permanent new kid in my life.

I'm not seen as a smart kid anymore. When I was younger I was the gifted kid that always got stuff right, knew more stuff than the textbook, the kid who was always correcting the teacher, the kid who everyone asked things they didn't know. I was the kid whose teacher, when they called their parents, always told them how their kid was a bright and gifted kid. Everyone had high expectations for me, but now I'm disappointing everyone with my dropping grades and depression.

Tbh, I feel like I'm tricking everyone who views me as a smart person. I feel like an imposter who everyone mistook as the gifted kid when I was younger. I feel like I'm one of the the r/iamverysmart people who insecure with their intelligence. I feel like my whole childhood was a lie. 

Now people who don't know me well think I'm 'average"". Worse, they see me as a lazy, creepy kid who forgets everything, doesn't understand social cues and eats lunch alone. I feel as if there is an underlying, constant ""rage"" about myself and everyone in my life. The ""rage"" sometimes makes me want to kill myself, or worse, kill everyone in my school. I feel like a terrible person, a being who can't be even described as ""human"" when I find myself imagining blowing up my school with a bomb. That ""rage"" seems to come from my insecurity. I feel so insecure sometimes that it turns into a full blown panic attack like I would never feel happy again, like every inch of hope has been sucked out from me. 

I'm confused about my dreams and major too. One day I want to be a programmer/developer, one day I want to be a professor in philosophy/history/neuroscience/astronomy, one day I just want to earn a living and be on the internet and game all day, one day I want to be a writer, one day I just want to fucking kill myself. My teachers pressure kids to choose their future jobs/major quickly. They are always doing activities that involve kids to write down their future majors and careers. I can't be honest with anyone, sometimes myself too. I feel like that ruined my whole dreaming thing beginning in 2018. I stopped to think about my possibilities and stopped being honest with myself and always thought that I was too late and wasn't qualified.

Sometimes I have the sudden urge to get my shit together and do something with this life. Then after a day when I find myself forgetting an assignment or procrastinating, I feel as if I can't never get my shit together and fall back into that viscous cycle again. This has happened to much to me that it sucked away the hope and made me thing I was going to be doomed forever.

No one cares.  I've been rejected by every person I've ever asked out.  I'm 24 and things just get worse.  Even when I'm doing financially well it still feels as though happiness is just a myth.  My only distraction from constantly thinking about painting the walls is working.  Everyone talks about the reasons people shouldn't kill themselves is the people they leave behind.  What happens when that person doesn't have anyone?  They wouldn't find my body till someone smelled it.  The friends I manage to make always disappear when I try to tell them about my depression.  It's like a weird magic trick.  I don't see any hope for turning my shit hole of a life around.  Im going to die alone, and unhappy.  Why not just speed this shit up?

98799,"What should I do? / VentingI've been severely depressed/suicidal for around 6 years but these last 2 years in particular, every day just feels like a rollercoaster of emotions.

One moment i'll be calm and in a relatively good mood and then after a few hours i'll be pulling out my hair and searching for painless suicide methods or have a million and one thoughts rushing through my head all at once whilst i'm in bed, unable or unwilling to move.

Due to a whole variety of medical issues and a general lack of energy (it all feels like too much to deal with) I haven't seen my doctor about any of these feelings. It seems after having these ""episodes"" I can calm down and manage to get motivated to book a doctors appointment. But due to a small appointment booking window (8am-8:30am) at my local GP, I find that the next morning I am completely unwilling to call and attempt to book an appointment due to fear and feeling overwhelmed.

I really need to get help because I just can't function anymore. i'm paranoid, at my lowest point, unemployed, causing stress for my parents and just want it all to end. This has ruined my life, I was getting good grades at school and had big plans for university and a career but dropped out completely to spend the next 4 years in on/off again entry level employment.

This is actually the only time I have ever spoken about my mental health with anyone as i'm just way too scared to tell my parents and friends so apologies if this comes across as incoherent rambling but it's rare for me to conjur up the effort to write a long post.

The latter is sometimes hard for me to do, but being an Anorexic, I know all about challenging yourself and others to think ""outside the box"" almost...to change your perspective on things to see if that doesn't help you think differently. That is what we did on the Eating Disorder Message Board that I used to be a part of a while ago. I was forced to leave because it is ONLY for recovery and I am not even close to that, and I haven't been for a long time. I am still deep in my ED, still actively restricting/purging (though NEVER binging) and I am suicidal more often than not, so I am excluded from posting until I am more recovery-minded. That is just how the rules are and I am OK with that.

I have my Manischewitz Concord Grape Wine here by me and I am getting pleasantly toasted. I can't get TOO drunk because my hubby has to go to work later and I have to be home with the kids, but I can drink until I feel happy. Please don't lecture me on alcohol and my meds (meh...haven't taken them today...I KNOW I KNOW...don't say it!) or that self-medicating is not the way to go. It is the only way I can feel better right now and it is legal. Now what I have planned for later is definitely NOT legal, but I don't care much. It is not like I will be out on the streets tokin'...my neighbor has a bowl and I've been invited over later for some fun while her daughter sits with the kids over at my house. I rolled my own joint a week or so ago (failed at it dammit...I am out of practice) and smoked it on my back roof that is right underneath our bedroom window. I got high and I felt better. I am self-medicating, self-harming in a way, and escaping this prison that is my mind.

But...I digress. Thank you to everyone here. I appreciate you and I am not in a really bad place at the moment...just depressed. I still think of suicide a lot, but right now, I don't feel moved to do anything of the sort. I don't want to...I am already feeling the effects of the alcohol and I feel...okay now.

343216,"I think I might be destined to commit suicideI was raised incredibly well. Somehow my parents pushed through their problems for 18 years, and gave me an incredibly loving and healthy upbringing. To the point where even my siblings and I didn't know they had major issues.

Then, when I was 18 they announced they were getting a divorce, and I guess they just gave up on the facade. But the change in my family was so drastic and so fast that it was traumatizing. Suddenly everything started going wrong in my life. I figured out my mom is basically a sociopath and an awful person. My dad has major abandonment issues and his only emotion is stress, and not one of my old friends or siblings can properly deal with their own or anyone else's emotions. AT ALL.

My siblings were all younger than me though and, because of their age, it didn't affect them in the same way it affected me. I had just become an adult and was experiencing an entirely new area of life right when it started. It was a very pivotal point for me. And I was by far the closest person to my mom out of anyone in the family.

At this point, after 5 years of this, I'm in a place I never wanted to be and never thought I would be. But because I was raised so well, my mind deals with it so incredibly differently than the average depressed person. I feel and think things that most other people simply can't understand.

It feels like I have two different lives. As if I have two lives in two separate timelines. Even my past. It feels like I have two different childhoods. In a way, it feels like ""healthy"" people only relate to half of me, and depressed people only relate to half of me.

I had been considering suicide off and on for the past two years, but just yesterday I was put into a situation that is literally inescapable. I don't just feel hopeless. I literally feel like the best option is suicide. The thought of dying sounds kind of nice in a way. I imagine that I would live in a dream like state. You can't ever get tired of dreaming because of whatever it is that happens in your mind, so I think death would have a similar effect.

But because of my upbringing, I can't let go of life. Somehow it has done this to my mind. I have such a strong will to live, but I am subject to what feels like the worst possible situation in the world. Both of those effects are because of my upbringing. And it feels awful.

But the more I think about it, the more I think that in the end, I'll probably commit suicide.

Edit: To whoever downvoted me, thanks asshole. I wrote this whole post explaining how misunderstood I am, and the only thing you could think was ""Wow, I'm so offended that I have to put you down to feel better about myself"" (which I can only assume had something to do with my post sounded too ""positive"" for a depressed person, or for sounding ""pompous"". Cause apparently only having a SUBJECTIVELY ""bad"" life is a legitimate reason to want to commit suicide). People like you make me sick. Thanks for proving my point that I am misunderstood and ignored.

It's like you have no fucking perspective. You're like ""I wanna put this person down cause his life is too good"" But that's exactly the fucking reason I'm depressed!

Last time I was too scared... what if it doesn‚Äôt work? What if it gets better? What will I be missing out on? Well this time, the fear is gone. Only thing that stopped me was the realisation that I can go out and get more, and really cut out any chance of making it out alive.

282399,"coping hurts so muchHello. I (18/F) have been suicidal for many years now, probably since around age 10 or 11. It was really bad a few years, then eh, then okay, and now, life is fleeting happiness, reliving trauma, and having those around me listen to me constantly mope about how much I want to just fade away.

I am a failure to my friends and family. My friends have abandoned and forgotten about me since we have graduated high school. It is impossible for me to make friends in college, and when I do make even the slightest bit of conversation, they walk away or something happens. For example, this coronavirus bullshit has put my college classes online for the rest of the semester. Which means no interaction with anyone other than family, girlfriend, and clients. Also means my grades will suffer, because I am terrible at online classes.

I hurt the people around me, especially my poor girlfriend. She loves me so much, I try to remember that. And it hurts her so badly when I tell her about my suicidal thoughts, but they are so constant and neverending during this time period. I am so scared to do anything, but it only gets worse and worse and I creep closer and closer to the edge of just doing it.

I can't take a day off and risk losing my job. I can't take a vacation, I don't have the money, as I spend it all on my girlfriend in hope that she will forever stay with me, and also on myself as one of many unhealthy coping mechanisms. I can't get therapy. I'm already on medication but I am terrible at taking it. There is nothing to do around ole northwest Indiana that will bring me joy. I have tried everything in an hour radius, and with college and school, I wouldn't have the time for anything else.

I am too young to buy alcohol, which I wish I wasnt lmao otherwise it'd be my vice. And now with that new law, I can't buy tobacco or nicotine products, which I have never tried but desire to. I've smoked weed twice and it really doesnt do much for me. Plus it's too much money for a shit high. I'm pretty much not close with anyone who could sell me drugs anyway which is shit.

I feel so trapped by my body because it's just so heavy sometimes and because my mind is as slow as if it were stuck in tar.

I keep having these dreams where I try to kill myself and I keep trying to fall back to sleep to revisit that wonderful relief I guess.

I hate being alive because it's so suffocating and I have just been in misery the past few weeks. in retrospect that doesn't sound so bad, but considering that this pattern repeats itself I guess it makes sense.

I haven't been able to talk to my friends and even talking to some of them trigger my depressing feelings or wanting to sh. It's awful and so hard to navigate interactions with people.
Ive just been in so much pain I really want to die.

I'm using what little energy I have to admit that I hate myself. I don't believe I am redeemable. I don't think I could even live a good life if I were to become happy  because I am still flawed and disgusting. I make other's lives hard and sad. Esspecially my family...
I'm so smart and gifted and I will be going to college soon but I really don't see how anything could make things better for me.

I have a bright future but I don't think anything will change my mind. It feels so bleak and painful going ahead on my path. Again, I am uninspired, irredeemable, disgusting, and I just am not capable of even being good in my eyes let alone another's eyes.

I fucked up.  During a manic period, I turned relatively nothing into a million dollars playing the game of speculation.  I lost my mind, and subsequently, nearly all of that money.

I have since gotten in shape, taken a shitty job with good benefits, and taken on some life insurance.  The grief is a killer- I'd have offed myself nine months ago if not for a wife and kid.  Anyway, the physical progress isn't translating into an improved mental state.  Knowing winter is right around the corner, with a history of seasonal affective disorder, I'm fucked. 

Yes, I should get on some meds.  Problem is, then I won't be able to get the additional life insurance.  So I continue to self medicate, fully planning to abstain from booze for a month or two before my next life insurance physical as I know my liver ain't happy and gotta get them enzymes down.  

Finances are the trigger.  Wifey biz always run like a hobby even though it occupies 40+ hours a week so some contribution would be nice, even though I fully admit to fucking up financially.  Fact is, I made the money same way it was lost.  That said, I am in no state to go it alone as sole breadwinner right now.

Times have changed, I am not capable of being the sole provider for this family (1 kid), and I will always see suicide as an option.  Of course, I don't expect someone w/o constant ideation to understand.  The mental process of the clinically depressed is fucked.  No, I'm not neurotic, I'm fucked up in the head.

Counting the days to that two-year uncontestability period and looking to add some premium in the mean time if I can get them enzymes in check.  Who knows when that car accident could occur?  

Tonight my little one yelled goodnight to me through the window as I cut the grass.  I nearly broke down walking behind the mower, once again reminded of my mistakes and my destiny.  going to miss those moments.  Tried to explain to the wife that I need her to help out financially and she acts as if things are the same as they've always been (business not contributing and even me bailing it out personally multiple times in the past).  Problem is, this isn't the past.  I am on the verge of suicide and don't feel I'm capable of more than I'm providing now.  Just a little help???

112220,"Depressive and suicidal liar looking for advice I guessHello everybody,
I am making this post because I have no idea what I should do.
My situation is that I am depressed and suicidal and next to that also an almost perfect liar. 
When I was young I was bullied because I am fat and had no single friend till I was around 13/14 years old. At that moment is was in school and got into gaming. School was easy for me and never had to learn a single thing to get a good grade. I got lazy this way. When I finished middle school I had to choose a direction of work I wanted to study for. I made a poor choice and already quit the study after a month. At this period I also got problems with my body because I was and am way to heavy. I had some surgeries and everything looked fine from the outside. However, I was feeling down all the time, I never talked with my friends anymore because they were studying and doing other stuff then gaming. I got isolated. The next year of school I started with a other study and fell in love with it. However, there were some problems. First, I am not a technical genius. To be fair, I suck at it and this study has quite some technical shit in there. So naturally, the lazy me, thought it would all be fine and didn‚Äôt study at all as always. However I failed al the theoretical parts about physics, chemistry and biology. Next to that, the isolated me, wasn‚Äôt able to make friends because I was completely withdrawn. I didn‚Äôt want to trouble my parents with this problem and started lying about how everything was going. I also moved out of my parents place for this study by the way. This way they couldn‚Äôt see what was going on, and when I was home I lied about everything. After a few months into the study I made one friend and we hit it off. But the stupid me also lied to him about almost everything. He is a great guy but I feel bad about lying to him and to my parents. I still always feel down and nowadays also started thinking about suicide a lot. I am afraid to confront my family and my friend about my lies. This is because almost everything is a lie. I won‚Äôt be the guy who they think I am and this scares the shit out of me. Next to that I am now in my second year and now I am forced of the study because I failed the tests about physics etc. So now I feel like a total dipshit, that is completely useless, a huge liar and that the persons around me would be better off without me.
I started talking to shrink but even to him I lie about a lot of stuff and it doesn‚Äôt help me at all because of it. 
I just wanted someone to hear my whole story, and maybe even give me advise. I don‚Äôt see a bright future for myself, and thus with other reasons ass well think I am going to commit suicide someday. I haven‚Äôt done it because I don‚Äôt want my family and only friend I have to go through the emotional pain.
Thank you for reading this in advance.

306237,"I need THIS life to stop.Hi there. This is my first post here but not the first time I stop to read, thanks for the support you give, it meant a lot even without being involved in the thread. 

I am sorry if this gets a bit too long, English is not my first language and I'm not used to talk about feelings, so I might need more words than strictly necessary. 

The main point of me writing this post is that I'm sick and tired of my life routine, but complaining about it only got me very bad reactions. 

Maybe I am lazy and spoiled, maybe I was too lucky for most of my life and now I can't cope with work because I have no discipline. That's what my girlfriend seems to mean when she complains about me complaining. 

I'm almost 31, for the last 15 months I've been working day and night with a partner on our own business. Things are starting to work out, we are hiring our first employee, who is finishing an internship in a month and seems to be a good fit. 

For the first time in months, last weekend I could sleep more than 6 hours and ""forget"" about work, maybe some day this week I can even get home before 20:00. 

Everyone around me says it is worth it, they seem to be pretty sure about it, way more than I am. They say it's an investment and we are lucky to have clients in this economy. 

Fuck that shit. I can't afford to buy soil for my plants (soil is dirt cheap, literally), I pay the bills and the end of the month starts on the 5th for me. Can't buy clothes to wear for work, can't go out to dinner, not a single night, can't afford my cat to be sick because that means using my business credit card and being even more broke for a couple of months. And I am hungry most of the time because my stomach is way bigger than my bank account. 

I think of death as a relief. I think of killing myself every day, but I just can't. It makes me think of my loved ones having to pay for a crappy funeral where no friends are going (I've been a terrible and very distant friend) and it makes me sadder, but it takes suicide out of the picture for a while. So I light up some weed and it lightens up my mind. I've been an occasional smoker since I was 16, but with my financial history I never had a chance to abuse. Last year I grew a couple of plants and that's how I can afford it now. For the last month I've been trying not to smoke for a week and didn't even get to the first 24 hours (I've had plenty of weed available for the last 7 months, but this habit is new). 

I don't know if the drug is causing a depression or a depression is making me use, but every day I feel like killing myself until I smoke and then I look at my problems in a different way. I wake up my ass from the couch, cook some shitty shit and go to bed defeated again. I can cook like a pro, but I just don't want to any more. 

It feels like the only thing I can decide about, and taking the choice of smoking again while I listen to some music is the only moment of happiness I can afford. 

My girlfriend used to be a loving and supportive one, but no one loves a broken man and I know it's just a matter of time till she leaves. It makes me sad, but I made up my mind long time ago, it's quite understandable, no one wants to live like this. 

For the business, things have been growing quickly for the last 5 months, at the beginning of 2016 I was looking for a job, just to know what I could afford to look for, but not with the biggest expectations. I got the interest of a couple of big firms, but I ratted out because I got some clients and I hoped things would get better faster. I always had problems with authority and I am scared of having a boss and not liking him, I tend to do stupid things like pointing it out in front of everybody. 

At this pace, I might be able to take some days off this year, but I don't know if I have the strength to get to that. I feel exhausted and sad. 

My mother, the one who might have spoiled me by filling my shelves with every book I asked for, was diagnosed with cancer last December. She's gonna make it, the diagnose was on time, but I haven't been able to visit since her first chemo session, which was at the end of January. And that hurts, like it hurt when I couldn't visit my younger brother in hospital after a spine surgery. 

I just can't find a meaning for all this. I find myself crying alone at least once a week, and that has never happened to me. I don't want to take any drugs, not even marihuana, of course. I just want to get back to the gym, sleep 8 hours and have some food on the table. And I feel so weak, because I know there are people out there with bigger problems who deal with it, but I can't even find support. People look at me like my brothers do: the big guy with tons of confidence and all the answers. But I am done, behind closed doors I am just done. 

I thought this was gonna make me feel better, but I already stopped twice to cry and that's too much feelings for me. Thanks for reading this, I hope I can write something funnier soon. ",suicide

196899,"Suicidal thoughts, and extremely overhwhelmedI'm going to apologize in advance for the wall of text I'm about to write. I will try to be concise as I can but it might be all over the place as my mind is scattered at the moment. 

To keep it short, I don't really have a support system. I was raised by my grand mother and she died 6 years ago. I don't know my father and my mother is a drug addict. I live in a home with my ex-girlfriend and her family because they feel sorry for me once my mother got us evicted from my previous home due to her drug use.

I just really feel in over my head. I can't even cry anymore because there's just numbness, and it seems like if I'm not having suicidal thoughts then I'm angry at myself and I just overflowing with rage. 

I tried to commit suicide last year by drinking myself to death but I woke up and that about the time I moved in with the family that I currently rent from. I had reached out to a therapist during this time but I couldn't afford to continue going to her. So I moved into with the people that I currently live with because they would help me to get on my feet. 

When I moved in, there was no real agreement on anything except that I would pay 30% of what I make as rent. I was initially fine with this and I got a job the week that I moved in and started paying from my first paycheck. I was pretty emotional when I moved back and they would scold me about keeping my room clean or moving anything around in it (because the room I rent used to be their other daughters who moved out) and they would constantly threaten to kick me out if I didn't abide by their rules. I know that they're in the right but it just seemed harsh at the time. Also, the owners of the house didn't communicate about when I would pay the rent. I would pay it to the wife and she wouldn't tell the husband. The husband would then proceed to text me nonstop until he got confirmation that I had paid the rent and sometimes would even text me obsurd dead lines like ""you pay rent on the 15th and the 29th"" Even though they're aware of my paydates being the 1st and the 15th. Additionally, When I moved in they had promised me one of their old vehicles once I got my license reinstated. (It was suspended due to unpaid tickets.) But unfortunately one day, I woke up to go to school and I had happened to ask the wife to give me a ride. When I got into the car the husband was with us and informed me that we'd be going to pick and pull (a car junkyard and parts exchange) to pick up money for the car that he promised me. It was kind of awkward to say the least because the husband didn't expect me to be in the car and I think that he felt ashamed. I assumed that he was just going to have his wife tell me that he'd decided to get rid of the car. He promptly told me that once I got my license that they would assist me in getting a vehicle or allow me to use one of their cars. It just hurt my feelings because a month later I got my license back and he had gotten ~$200 for a working car. I told him that I would've just paid him that much, but he never really addressed it again. Once I received my license, they then told me I couldn't use any of their cars because I didn't have insurance. Well, I couldn't insure myself under one of their cars and they said that they wouldn't add me to their insurance because it would raise their rates and they ""know I couldn't pay the difference"". Honestly I know that I'm being ungrateful but I've just been told lies by a lot of people in my life constantly, all the way back to when my mother would call me while she was high and promise to come visit me and never show up. It just really hurts and it makes me feel like I can't believe anything that anyone says and it makes me not want to trust anyone more then I already do. I just have a hard time believing what anyone says.

Lately I've just been so overhwhelmed. Since I moved in here I've worked 3-4 jobs while taking 12+ units in school and biking ~50 miles a week to get places. I don't really get encouragement from the people I live with, but only scolding. That I don't clean my room enough or I don't try hard enough to save money and I know all of these things but I'm just so tired all the time from the travel and the stress of work and school and the little money I have left over to buy food for myself. I don't eat well and it's gotten worse since I've been depressed. I rarely eat enough a day, and there's not really food within the house. I can't really shop to buy any food  because the fridge is full and I can't have food in my room so if I buy food for snacks or something to go then it gets eaten.

I know that I make excuses and that's all I really do. I'm full of excuses and unfulfilled potential. I'm really good at pushing people away and hurting others. 

I had horrible teeth growing up and my grandmother was a compulsive smoker who smoked inside the house and I was teased relentlessly growing up for smelling like smoke and not being able to close my mouth. I didn't really have friends and I've always been the outsider. At home and in public, because my grandmothers health deteriorated and I had to move in with friends of the family who just made me clean up after their kids and tell me that I wasn't apart of their family while verbally and sometimes physically abusing me.

I guess I bring that all up because I've just had this life filled with pain and tragedy and I just don't see the purpose in continuing it. I just don't want to struggle anymore and be constantly reminded that I'm on the outside and I'm not special and I'm not good at anything and I lack the motivation to follow through or be good at anything so what do I have to look forward to. I could never ask someone to take on that kind of darkness because it would be too much for someone else to bear, all of the sadnesss and pain that I've been through and how unpredictable and sometimes malicious that it makes me. I don't want to put anyone through that, and who could love someone like that. Who's so broken purposeless and lost. I wouldn't want to love someone like that so I don't expect someone else to. 

I come from the poorest of poor circumstances, and I'm not smart. I'm 26 and still trying to transfer to a four year college because I promised my grandmother that I would. My major? Graphics design but I'm not talented in that at all and that will just lead me to more poverty and unhappiness. I really just don't understand what motivates people to live? Whats the purpose? 

I used to love video games and now it really doesn't fill the void. I used to be religious but it stopped making sense to me and the people I was closest to became hypocritical and I left that behind. I used to love to play guitar until I just didn't feel like I was progressing. I used to love to sing but I don't really have a good voice and I didn't really see improvement practicing. I used to love to play basketball but I'm just kind of a joke at that. I used to like to design and then I just gave up on that because I really just didn't feel that good at it. I just give up on shit too soon and I can't follow through. 

I know that I vicitimize myself, I know that I make too many excuses and I lie sometimes. I've hurt others and I get too angry sometimes and I say things I don't mean. I'm really ditzy sometimes in addition to being extremely forgetfull and sometimess really dense. I just feel that I was meant to be on the outside looking in.

I really feel like if I just keep living it will only get worse. I watched my grandmother slowly die from lupus and congestive heart failure while slowly smoking herself into that grave. I watched her give up on anything that she cared about and push nearly everyone else away from her and I feel like I'm heading down the same path.  I heard my mother yell at me when she was drunk and tell me that she wished she'd aborted me. I listened to her tell me that I'd never meet my father because he ran the brothel she worked at and raped her. 

I just don't really feel like I have any reason to live anymore. I just make excuses and constantly don't measure up. Where would I fit in life? I don't think that I'm strong enough to find my own place. There's people in much worse conditions then me and probably don't complain nearly as much which just makes me feel even more worthless. I know that I'm just this big victim and crybaby and I've gotten pity my whole life but not a lot of people have just loved me for me and not pitied me for my circumstance. 

I can't even remember the last time that someone asked me how I was and really meant it or opened their ear to listen to how I felt instead of just telling me that I should keep trying because it will be worth it? or that theyve been through what I have and they made it out just fine but I dont' think that I've ever met one person who's been through as much as me, I've met people who've  haven't been through as much, people that I grew up with and theyre addicted to drugs or drinking and that's all they really do.

I'm sorry for rambling but I think that I just wanted it throw it out there somewhere to say that I did. If you've read the entire thing and you have a perspective that might help or even resources in California that someone who is low income might be able to utilize I am open to pretty much anything. Though I've tried the scaling price and most of the time I really didn't feel like it helped. I was talked at and told solutions and not really listened to. I don't understand how someone can help me if they don't know anything about me. I honestly don't know why I'm reaching out but probably just because I'm too much of a coward to really actually hang myself. Sorry to be so dramatic but I'm just trying to be open as possible so when this is read it's a real glimpse into my mind.

295589,"Seeking help/adviceI'm 23 years old. 

All things considered, I have such a spoiled and entitled life. My family immigrated to the U.S. when I was 8, and last year I graduated from college. Both my parents work their asses off for our home to become a stable middle-class family. Nothing really particular happens within my home and everything seems ok from the outside. 

I don't think I've always been depressed and suicidal. In college I majored in philosophy, which allowed me to gain new insight and perspective on life. I especially latched onto the existentialist movement, wherein the principle of life as inherently meaningless and full of suffering seemed especially attractive to me. I do not want to blame my academic interest as the reason I am here. It's just that my nihilistic tendencies sprung out from these experiences. Throughout college, I also developed a drug addiction. Marijuana, xanax, cocaine, psychedelics. You name it, I've done it and then some. 

Fast forward and it's been a year since I graduated. I've been prepping full time for law school, given that my major did not lead me to instant employment and the consensus within my family was that I go down this path. But while studying for the LSAT, I have come to the realization that I may not be cut out for this. The problem is that I have no other option, and I am running out of time. Everyone around me is making it in one way or another. I dread waking up everyday and having to be in my body. I feel like an immense failure. I want to leave. 

Literally the only thing that is holding me back is the guilt I will cause my loved ones. Just the thought of how bereaved my parents and girlfriend would be if I were to commit suicide is unbearable. This tension has been tearing me apart for a while now. Truly a catch-22.

This is my first time reaching out to the reddit community. I hope that you all could provide me with some helpful advice, seeing that I cannot and will not talk about this with anyone close to me. I appreciate your time",suicide

311246,"A permanent solution to a temporary problem of existence.I have no joy in life. There is not a single person out of the many many people I know that make me feel ok to be me. No one loves me back no matter how much love I give them. There is clearly a flaw in my ability to interact with other people. I am in my mid 30s and have done more to work on these flaws than I can possibly describe. At some point the effort becomes more than the payout. I am at constant odds with everyone around me no matter who they are or where I am. 
Evolution is not a streamlined operation. There are enormous avenues for life to take and not all, in fact very few last long at all. The unfortunate side of this process is that many forms of life are brought into existence only to suffer and die as nothing more than a fluke or odd fuck up. The benefit of being human is that I can recognize myself as one of these flukes and take myself out of the gene pool before I reproduce or cause anymore harm. 
I live in constant pain and suffering. My quality of life is so low I  pray to whatever can hear me, every single night to, please let me die in my sleep. Why is it ok for people is physical pain and suffering to end their lives but not for people suffering emotionally? Instead I must go about causing physical pain and suffering to my body until I die. Don‚Äôt let that last sentence go by you so quick, read it again. Do you have any idea how hard it is to kill yourself without a gun? 
There is nothing left to live for except the natural fear of pain and death. So I leave this posted here as a sort of note.

144282,"Having thoughts of suicide, life just seems like to much effort. (21M)A bit about my current situation:


First thing, i'm not depressed, i'm not even unhappy, i in fact have a happy relationship, supportive family and a few good friends, im a bit cynical but i'm usually in rather good spirits. But i have had bad times when i was still a little kid (4-16) with an abusive stepparent (he's outta my life now, plus i don't think he is really relevant to my suicidal thoughts).I'am also a student in a university (zoology), i'am not doing well in it as i'm not overly smart and i have very little motivation even though i find the topic interesting. I am socially awkward but ive grown to accept it and don't really see the implications as negative. I also have motivation issues since i was 14ish years old. Ive never really been passionate about anything but video games, anime or just chilling with friends or my girlfriend. 


Why i'm having thoughts on suicide:


I'm having thoughts on suicide as i just don't think the effort it takes to be happy in life is worth the actual happiness i will gain. Like i will struggle through a hard uni course which i wasn't fully prepared for (more then likely fail realistically) and then i may possibly get a low paying job (animal related jobs tend to be low paying) and have to worry about money for the rest of my life while i try to enjoy myself in the good moments and support my hobbies. I know this sounds really negative, and i guess it is, but i honestly think this is a realistic view on the future of my life and how i think the average Joe's life will be, yes there will be good times, there will be happy times.

Life just seems like a lot of stress and effort for some happiness, i know its normal for people to have to stress their way through their jobs and life etc but i just don't have the motivation to do all of that. I guess its just laziness at the core of it, but stress does not make me happy, like if i was rich and was set for life or even most of it then i wouldn't bother committing suicide as the amount of stress in my life would drastically go down, obviously deaths would occur etc etc but stress would still be minimal. 

I doubt i will accomplish anything, or change anyone's life drastically. i know i make some people happy, and i will probably be missed for X amount of time, but i think i'm kind of just replaceable in most people lives. 

I have thought of ways i could off myself, don't worry i'm not going to off myself in the near future and its not something i'm considering at the moment per say, it would be something i consider, like moving house is a long thought out decision and at the moment, i'm not ready to commit suicide.  I also do not fear death, i fear pain that death may bring, but not death (also incredibly curious of what death brings)

Its something i always have as an option and always have since i was like 14 you could say, its never not their but sometimes its more obvious

I also think i would rather be homeless sometimes ( i know coming from someone whos never been homeless it sounds bad) but i just feel i would rather go hungry and cold then stick to a really stressful timeline and life.


To conclude:


I know this post must sound so selfish and petty compared to everyone elses problems and i'm not 100% sure that this isn't even the place for it. I'm just trying to understand why i feel this way as the thoughts are more prominent while going through this stress at uni.

I also don't particularly want to tell my family or friends as they are the type to stage and intervention or something.

Also sorry if this post is messy and hard to understand.

114749,"Help with a loved one ...tl;dr our adult son tried to commit suicide for the second time in as many weeks. He is currently stable, and safe at the hospital.

At this point, his mom and I fear it's only a waiting game of ""when will I get away with it"" .... We don't know what to do. 

For some back story, our son is trans, on HRT and under the care of several doctors, and at least one therapist; he does not live with us anymore - he moved out almost two years ago, and since then he has gone down hill mentally. He's been in a psyche hospital three times now (four once the hospital he's currently at sends him back). He used to talk to us about his mental well-being. Nothing was taboo. We had in depth conversations about what ifs, and woulda couldas, etc. When mom and I didn't have an answer, we sought outside help in the form of therapists or actual psychiatrists (always his choosing and choice, never ours - don't think that we were like ""OMG SEND HIM TO A SHRINK""! kind of parents.)

The doctors and therapists and such have swapped up his medications so many times over the past two years - I believe he's been on just about everything by this point. (Since he's now an ""adult"", I don't know EXACTLY what he's been taking and how things have swapped, only that they have)

I don't know what to do. His mom cried herself to sleep, again, tonight because she doesn't know if she'll have her son tomorrow. His autistic little brother (15) went to bed confused because mom &amp; dad were frantically on the phone with doctors and EMTs when it was his bed time ... and here I am, at 2:30am, drinking and pleading with internet strangers for advice and help because I am so very scared.

I don't know what to do. I am scared. I have always, my entire life, known what to do; for the first time I am begging for help from someone. Anyone. 

I cannot wake up to ""that call"". Please, any advice,  I literally beg you; provide it.",suicide
112522,"Is this Suicide Ideation/Suicidality or OCD? Can't tell, so much confusion. Do I sound suicidal? Please read carefullyI am so confused guys.
So, basically my story with HOPEFULLY Harm-OCD began 5 months ago, It was triggered by reading the news about Chester's bennington suicide. I am 20 years old male, with a previous history of OCD(Fear of getting a heroin addict.), but I can't tell if it is the same or worse. It is horrific.
Here is what happens.
After I read the news, in my head went something like 'If he can do it, then why shouldn't I?' And I started having intrusive suicidal thoughts, I will give an example:

-A friend: Lets go and drink a coffe tomorrow.

-Me: Okay

-My mind: If I don't suicide by then.

So basically at the begining (the first few hours) It was terrifying, but I was unaware what is going to happen after this.

So I got pretty paniced and googled: 'intrusive suicidal thoughts' and major depessive disorder or OCD showed up. I entered both web pages and both said '10 times higher chance of commiting suicide.'

This was the moment when everything fell appart.

This was the moment when I felt this rapid change in my mind.

This was the moment in which I felt like a part of me changed into something horrific.(Okay this was too much movie like sentence, but anyway.)

So basically my life is pretty rough since then I will try to be as accurate as possible, I have days in which I feel relatively normal. So, here are the things happening in my head and body. Some of them are constant, some of them are not.

Intrusive suicidal thoughts which feel real. I really hope they are intrusive, and not true Suicide Ideation. With a confusion If I want them or not. Which is terrifying.

Knot in the stomach.

Whenever I look online for something to buy, there is a feeling like 'There is no point I won't be here soon' and a knot in the stomach.

Feeling like I can't do anything fun, like can't relax I don't know how to describe it.

Less interest in people.

Less apetite.

Sudden feeling of tiredness sometimes.

Nearly constant, uneasiness.

Scary feeling, when I imagine my life without these thoughts, it feels like kind of boring?! I don't know it this is the right word.

Feeling on the edge, feeling like my life is shortened, like I will do something bad soon.

Random feeling of life being pointless without a reason with a variating duration.

Random TERRIFYING Intese feeling like trapped in life.

Random feeling that I need to escape, but there is no place to.

When I am feeling bad, there are constant thoughts, random things I have read on google reddit, with a pictures of the article I was reading.

I stopped working, and now I feel like If I work or feel overwhelmed I will do it.

I stopped University becausw of it, and because I didn't find it interesting.(I made a mistake with chosing my subject.

Intrusive unsettling feeling real scenarious in which my best friend tell me If I want to work with him.(We had a pretty sucessful store.

Feeling like I don't want to admit that I am suicidal?!

Feeling like I don't want to get better?!? I tried finding a reason, but I can't think a reason why, like I stop thinking when I try.

Fear that I developed these thoughts, a few days before Chester's thing, and I try to see my chats to see if there are some signs, but it is impossible to be sure.(This is not a big deal, but I am trying to be as accurate as possible.)

At first I thought this is depression, however I don't show many signs of depression. Then I thought it is Anxiety, but It feels darker and realer than Anxiety.

Weird negative feeling when babies arround.

Random feeling like everything I see is too much?

Fear/Feeling like this is something unknown, incurable and it is impossible to feel like before.

Intense moments when I feel like I am losing control. (I will give you an example of what it looks and feels like.) It happened 2-3 times for the last 5 months.

And the most important and horrific:¬†
Scary intense moment with like a physical urge ######6. As it follows:
It is triggered randomly.
This is what happens: life feels meaningless with a weird image stuck in the back of my head feeling, like future idk, feeling of unrasiness, unsettled feeling, negative scenarious, I try to calm myself with a positive thoughts, I succeed for like a second, then it feels like the negative thoughts, reinforce themselfs and become more and more intense, then I am like 'If i feel like i will do something i will go to the hospital, chill., then like 'it doesn't matter you feel trapped' and it becomes even more intense and more intense uneasiness feeling, i close my eyes laying in my bed, almost starting to feel normal for a couple of seconds, then i open my eyes and everything in my head is intense again, i try again to counter them, it becomes even more intense.

I have several questions:

Can OCD feel like a desire?!?!

How long does OCD urges last?

Was this actual s urge or ocd?!

What does it look like?

Does it look like actual suicide ideation/suicidality?

Thanks in advance.

I thought that parents give you support, but all they do is to mock me/bully me for what I do and how I look like. I just feel like not trusting anyone, I fucking hate my life so much. It hurts so bad, I just want to end it.

Now I can't even cry for tiny bit because of the negative stereotypes that I get, from being called gay to being yelled at for crying over a stupid thing. I just wanted to release my emotions, only more personal now.

I just feel like my life's spiralling out of control. I told people that I know that I have this shit and that shit, and that I needed a therapist so I can improve. But shit just told me that it's not worth going to any therapists and that I can deal with it myself. Told me to not think about it and it'll all get better.

Life has no meaning anymore. I'm not looking towards my future, it's just dark and small that I don't think I can reach, even with great effort, y'know. I'm not significant, when I die, nothing will change except for he fact that I disappear, but it's not that big of deal.

I wanna feel what love is, but it just gives me a terrible day whenever I feel happy. Constantly being judge by society, I can't cry because I'm a man. I feel shunned by everyone in my area, because i feel ""Different"" and don't belong to anyone at all.

I'm just tormented by my constant negative thoughts , drowning inside my own mind, trapped inside my own bottled up feelings. But I just don't feel like opening up to anyone. Always have I been hating myself, being isolated with my own insecurities about everything.

Made a few cuts on my arm, and I feel like wanting to do it again. It's the only thing that releases me from the stress I experience. Lost several of my friends due to how I acted. Now I just, Idk anymore. I just feel like jumping off a building, putting a gun to my head, sleeping pills, just anything to end my life forever.

I'm so fucking sorry that I'm such a disappointment to y'all, i just can't take it anymore. I'm sorry. I'm just so sorry. I am a worthless living piece of shit, living life isn't worth it anymore. I just take up so much oxygen when better people need it.

I just feel sorry for the people who are with me. They don't know I'm just a biodegradable piece of shit ready to be thrown out. I'm just really sorry about everything I have done. I tried my best to make things right, but I can't, no matter how hard I try. I'm so sorry.

Last Spring I received an email from my prospective college saying that I had been denied admittance. At the time it just seemed like another bump in the road. I thought ""okay, I'll just go to community college for a couple years and we'll take it from there."" But as the summer came closer, and my high school career came to a wrap, I felt myself becoming more and more detached from reality. I had received a fabulous two year scholarship to a community college, was going to live with my parents for free, and I had a decent part-time job. I thought I had the next few years set up well, but I still couldn't get over the numbness in the back of my mind.

I can tell that my friends can see it too. They tell me that I get more emotional now than ever before, and I find myself making up excuses just to not go out with them. To me, a night laying in bed and falling asleep for hours on end seems way more appealing than going out with my friends and finding fun things to do. I long for the days where I had limitless amounts of energy, and would often go for a week without more than 3 hours of sleep at a time. I long for the days where I lusted for a partner, instead of just casually glancing at attractive people. I long for the days where things interested me.

Their chatline was very nice, so if that lady sees this 'Natasha', thank you. However afterwards I did call the line and the lady was nice however I'm very socially inept and bad at explaining how I feel verbally as well as starting conversations. So I was a bit upset when the first thing she asked me was if I had abused drugs or alcohol. Later I was transferred to a self harm hotline instead, even though I am suicidal. The man, I'm guessing a volunteer most likely, was a bit rude. When I mentioned a weight problem of mine, keep in mind I'm a 14 year old girl, he asked my weight and height and when I told him he said I had more work to do. Then, when i mention my family problems he got really upset and starting like semi being yelling and just aggressive towards me? Eventually he just straight up hung up on me. I dont know where to else just talk about this, because this was just so- I dont even know. It was an incredibly offputting experience. I feel trapped and alone and dont wanna exist. I dont know how to tell people that I want to kill myself without- freaking myself out. I dont like hearing those words come from me. I dont know how to get help and it's so hard to explain that to people. Whenever my family even gets the idea that I want to, the way they ask just sounds like they're disgusted with me.

There is one that I want to bring up b/c it's a nasty catch 22...

As I understand it if you spend more days of a month IN the ward than OUT of it, you loose your disability for that month. If I do this I will be homeless (again) and this is not an option.

I haven't figured out yet how to exit this world. I must think of a way that will have the least amount of impact. Mainly, so my kids know as little as possible about my death. But also, because my life had little impact.

However, the guilt and sadness over possibly hurting my daughters is crushing my heart. 
I just had to write this, so I knew all I am feeling is real.

In the words of the awesome George Carlin, ""Be Excellent to Each Other.""",suicide

I bring him to visit every other weekend and some holidays. We have a blast every time he comes.

He‚Äôs into game streams, things like among us, fortnite, FIFA. When he comes over here he plays them but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs allowed any of this at his mom.

He is an avid footballer as well. Wants to become professional.

He started sending me YouTube videos of funny memes, funny moments in games, etc

I‚Äôm not sure how to respond?

310519,"I've hurt someone innocent and soon EVERYONE will know.More than 4 years ago I got drunk and cheated on my gf at the time. Never told her about it and basically put it out of my mind. She had been in a bad relationship before and thought that I was amazing and the one for her. I decided that it would be best for both of us if I shouldered the guilt of the cheating and was confident that I would never be found out. All of our friends at college were basically mutual too, so I knew if the truth came out I would be left with no one. We broke up 3 years later and we have both been with a couple of other people since then.

Now I am awaiting the results of my first ever STI test and having done some research I am now fairly confident that I caught chlamydia from the girl I cheated with. The results should be here tomorrow and if they do turn out positive I will have to confess. Chlamydia can cause infertility if left a long time and I can also now recall an incident that should have tipped me off that something was wrong soon after I caught it, but I always had it in my head that what I did with the other girl could not have given me an STI, and that she would be clean etc. Having finally ended my blissful ignorance by reading up on things I can't understand how this never occurred to me before. We basically had the symptoms staring at us right in the face but we never diagnosed it as I never had any sexual experience before her, and she had only done up to oral on her previous bf. He could have had something I suppose, but the timing of things is too perfect for it not to have been me. All experiences with doctors would have been influenced by this.

I've been reading posts on here all day from people who have been screwed over and are suicidal because they are victims. I am not the victim here. I always thought I was a good person and I dno't understand how I cuold have done this. I am about to lose everyone I value, and I deserve it.

I don't know why I'm posting here to be honest, but I have been thinking about throwing myself off of something high since I put these pieces together last weekend. I'm set on confessing everything to everyone and doing the right thing but that won't make up for this by a longshot if any permanent damage has been done to my ex or anyone else. I don't think I'll be able to live with myself after tomorrow, and I don't think anyone around me will be willing to let me live with myself either. I can't sleep or eat.

I was always depressed and suicidal, but I never associated it with what happened in the past. Now I'm being told that it's exactly why you're feeling this way.

210823,"Somehow, I'm here again.After a bit of scrounging around Google and having the Suicide Hotline suggested to me multiple times, I came back here and made an account while I'm still alone in the living room. 

I'm a college kid. In the middle of one of my recent midterms last week, I thought about how it'd be like to die. Not really the *how* of it but more if I'd have to experience all of this all over again. In the following days I mapped out a plan while walking between classes, ignored calls from my parents, started blowing my money on coffee and games when I wasn't thinking about anything else. At one point, it struck me that I'd have to account for my little sister, too, and I figured that she'd be who I wrote to; I laid down a bit, cried, because she doesn't deserve having an older sibling commit suicide, but I don't think I'm strong enough to live on that thought alone. If I wrote anything to her, I don't think I could get past 'I'm sorry'. 

The rest is a bad compilation of depression, the effects of shitty parenting, and the fact that I'm a waste of my family's funds with every second that goes by. I wish I was better than this, or that it was easy to die, because the sheer fear of how painful it might be is leaving me in this crippling state of emotion. 

I'll probably go once I'm done with this quarter, and enjoy whatever's between now and then. ",suicide
254162,"Am I a femcel? If I am, how do I stop being so pathetic? I'm 15. I keep telling myself that I'm just too fat and too ugly, and no one's ever going to love me because I've been caring about wanting a boyfriend for 5 years now. When I was 10, I was always jealous of my classmates who had boyfriends and while their relationships were fleeting and stuff, it would make me so mad because it hurts how boys don't like me.

Fast forward to now, I've grown to hate couples I see in the hallways. I can't stand the girls with makeup and ridiculous false lashes (I like the look of false lashes even though I've never tried them, but let me tell you, the ones these girls wear are too much.) I don't like them because they get all the boys without trying. I know it's 50% makeup but I want to be them. I just want to be loved. It's not like I don't take care of myself, I try to dress nice and I shower everyday and put some perfume on before going to school. I workout and try to eat healthy, because maybe guys don't like me cause of my weight. (5'2"" 160lbs)

It feels like I'm cursed because no one and I mean NO ONE has ever been interested in me. At least no one who I'm interested in has been interested in me, the feelings are never mutual. I can only think of 2 boys that have liked me. One who was 3 years younger than me and liked me when I was 8, and my classmate who liked me when I was 12. I'll call him J. J was one of those ""weird"" kids.. He kept putting stuff in his mouth back then and he always looked at me like he was mad at me. It was kind of starling looking up at my work back then and just seeing him like that.

Anyways, I digress. I don't know if I'll ever be loved. I just want a hand to hold and someone to cuddle with and sneak a quick kiss before heading to class. Why is it too much to ask? There's girls my age who aren't that skinny either or model-pretty, how come they have boyfriends? Why is love so confusing? I can't help but feel that it's turning me into a monster of some sort.

I live in SoCal and I‚Äôm never rains. It was finally on the forecast so, but I knew it would only be in the morning so I woke up early at 5:30 to go sit in the rain. I invited my friend to come and she suggested we paint (which is somethings she‚Äôs wanted to do for a while). I was excited because I know she isn‚Äôt the biggest fan of sitting in the cold so I was glad we were going to be doing something she wanted to do to. I got all ready and drive to her house and sat outside for 50 min, but she never came out. I sat there as I watched the rain fad away and the sky turn blue. I missed the rain.

I knew that she just fell back asleep, which I would be mad about except for the fact that she texted me 20 seconds before I texted her I was there. She could not have fallen asleep in that 20 seconds especially if she had gotten up and gotten dress. It couldn‚Äôt have been an accident. I know it was her plan from the beginning.
I get that she just didn‚Äôt want to go because she was gonna be cold I guess. Idk why. But I brought tea and even a space heater and an expert ion cord because I knew there was an outlet at the park. I don‚Äôt understand why she couldn‚Äôt have just texted me that she wanted to do it later. I don‚Äôt get it. I would have gone to see the rain myself. I guess she didn‚Äôt know how much it meant to me. 

But now (exactly as I expected) she calls me saying she‚Äôs sorry and that she fell asleep. Then precedes to say that if I called instead of texted she would have gotten up, because her text notifications are off ( straight up not true because I saw her 12 hours ago and they were on). Now she saying we should paint later now that it‚Äôs stopped raining. 

I‚Äôm so sick of being manipulated into what she wants to do. She‚Äôs done this before. She says we are gonna do something then once I get there all the sudden the plans have changed in such a way that she could have only planned from the beginning. She says we are going for a hike, she picks me up and she‚Äôs wearing flip flops, we end up just sitting one the grass. 

I‚Äôm sure she does this because she thinks I will say no, but so what if I would say I don‚Äôt want to do it. Why force me to do something I would have a bad time doing. I don‚Äôt understand. I don‚Äôt want her to do things she doesn‚Äôt want to do either, so I would respect if she just said no. Standing me up makes me way more upset then if she had just said no. I missed the rain. I wanted it so bad. It meant so much to me and I just sat in front of her house watching it fade away. Why did she do that?

Now she is texting me and apologizing saying it was an accident. Clearly it wasn‚Äôt, she knows I know it wasn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs making me feel like I don‚Äôt have a right to be upset or mad at her. She should have just said no. I don‚Äôt want to be forced to forgive her. She is also acting like painting now later is like her apology to make it better, even though this was her plan from the begging to trick me into doing it later. I hate painting, she knows that. The only reason we were gonna do it is because of the rain. But I missed the rain just like the last two times. She knew I didn‚Äôt want to miss it this time. The rain is gone now.",non-suicide

334440,"""It's the most selfish thing anyone can do""That's what my stepmother said about suicide. Nice dinner table conversation for a nice family gathering, celebrating one nameday and two birthdays (one of them my own, anyone else in a crisis because they didn't think they'd live to be 20?). Had to pretend the whole time I'm normal, in no way involved or affected by the topic, haha. I had no idea the whole time how many people here even know I'm seeing a psychologist and all that stuff (one of my stepbrother's seeing a psychiatrist, so it's not that they're judgemental, it's just that he's 'valid'). 
I had no idea how she could say such things, especially in the context of how she had thoughts about this, too. How she agrees that there might be times, where even if by being here we can help others, it's the most selfish thing in the world to give that oppurtunity up. (What the FUCK.)
One step-brother and one other family member, who had an attempt herself, started to set her to rights. Meanwhile I was busy being a coward, trying not to show I was hurt, trying not to cry, poker face. Dad was sitting beside me and I lay on his shoulder for a long time, staying silent. He eventually asked me jokingly ""are you falling asleep?"". It's better if he doesn't get the situation, and I just needed the contact, anyway. 
Only my psychologist knows, and I don't know how long I'll be seeing her. (Well, and anyone on the internet who cares to know, and we joke about it with my friends, which I know might be harmful -- but if we didn't laugh, we'd cry.)

I wouldn't classify myself as at risk; I simply won't do that to my wife. As bad as things are for me, I can't imagine giving her that grief. 

So the worst part of SI, no one believes me. Often I feel I want to do it just so people would have taken all the help I've requested seriously. Instead, I'm called a malingerer. I'm labeled as one trying to con the system. I'm treated as a criminal for not having the will to deal with job stress anymore. I've given up fighting for what I believe in and getting what I want, aside for a discharge. 

I feel like I'm downing. I feel imprisoned. I haven't been seeing any help for the last six months since the only outcome is more restrictions on the limited freedom I have. As soon as you mention suicide, you're targeted for ""help."" Not one of my superiors has wanted to help; they just want to cover their assess in the event something happens. 

So yeah. I'm not in a great place. If anyone wants to chat a bit (military preferred), shoot me a PM. I could use a stranger to vent to.

I will always be blamed for my problems. I am the victim of this cruel world. Nothing is alright and won't change.""this is why you're single""

I hate this phrase and I've seen it a TON recently -- mainly not directed at me, although that too...but I've seen it directed at other people multiple times a day.

Here is why I think you should never use that phrase here:

1. It gets things in the wrong order. I was not born angry and frustrated and socially awkward, I was molded into who I am by decades of bullying, rejection, ostracization, and abuse. I did not choose to feel angry--in fact, i can only remember being angry once in my first 16 years. No, i used to be an incredibly easy going person. But with people just as with dogs there's a certain amount of behavior they learn from others. Im mad, im awkward, im depressed -- whichever trait you want to pin my being FA on you can be damn sure it wasnt always there. Tl;dr loneliness precedes anger, bitterness, resentment.

2. It assumes my online anonymous account is in any way a reflection of reality. I mean...hahaha are you serious? Of course its not. Are you a child? You're acting like a child who hasn't stepped outside the world. Maybe because children don't keep their thoughts entirely to themselves. They don't have a filter.

3. Cheap way of ""winning arguments."" So you provoke me, and then you say ""well this response is why you're single."" GREAT JOB YOU SCORE A POINT WHOOHOO. Thats literally the only outcome. Or do you expect me to say ""gosh, you're right, the fact that I don't enjoy strangers lying, telling stories, and making shit up about me -- that's why im single!""

4. You might be wrong. Who the fuck are you? Relationshipus, the god of getting into relationships?

5. We all know you're wrong. I know absolutely psychotic people who got married and have casual sexual encounters. People sometimes get so angry they kill their spouses with kitchen knives. Spouses. Meaning they got married. Hitler was married. Its all bullshit: anger, bitterness, and resentment are in fact considered ATTRACTIVE by many women if the guy in question is hot. After all, attitude doesn't matter when you're having a fuck! You fuck attractiveness. Not ""attitudes"" and ""personalities.""

6. It has been brought to my attention that it is NOT in fact true that many women have put a positive spin on their abusive partners bad traits. This is true speaking from a scientific/psychological/sociological standpoint, BUT it implies that not every woman is perfect, so I sincerely apologize. I invite any one of you who felt personally victimized or hurt by my post to come to my house and kick my in the balls, while I repeat over and over a mantra like ""I now know that women never make mistakes.""

I hope this apology does its part to end sexist, minimize the wage gap, and erase rape from the United States. Yours truly, changeIsTheWay.

I would come to peace if we taught children from a young age that ""its ok to be ugly. Its ok to be a male virgin.""  But society acts like good looking men and women have achieved things to make them successful in that part of life. I always feel like I'm a loser even though deep down its not my fault. I didn't choose to be ugly and short. But people act like everything is under my control. As if I've done it all myself.

Nobody understands me. Nobody hears me though. They keep telling me that ""you don't need to be wanted to be happy."" Who are they? If they were in my shoes, they wouldn't last a day. Who are they to tell me what can and can not make me happy?

They make dumb assumptions like ""you don't shower"" or ""you're probably obese"" or ""get out of the house."" Do they realize how pretentious and insulting this is? I'm doing everything I can to try to be physically appealing to women. I'm nobody's choice though. ",suicide

Virtually all I do, other than work, is sit in my room and listen to sad music.  I am depressed and do not find amusement in things that I used to.  I have had girls at work show interest in me and talk to me, but I feel like I always drive them away with my incredibly bland and monotone responses-- even though I am interested, I guess I am just not socialized.

I live with my parents and 2 siblings.  My siblings are no more than just housemates, I never talk to or interact with them-- they have completely different interests and I feel weird and awkward initiating stuff with them because we have never hung out or shared interests or got along well at all quite frankly.  I am not even on speaking terms with my mother.  She is so self-centered and the least empathetic person I have met.  I was supposed to go on vacation next week.  I have a diagnosed condition called paruresis, it is basically extreme bathroom shyness. I need to stop at more private, less busy bathrooms on roadtrips.  She asked my not to go-- because my accommodations would cause her stress and inconvenience. She has never understood this issue-- which has drastically affected my life and opportunities, and is the root of my depression and probably the reason I have no friends.  Because I always stay in.  She constantly dismisses my diagnosed phobia/condition.  ""Oh thats still an issue?""  ""Just relax and pee, I dont understand why its so hard"". It infuriates me even typing it.

181749,"Boyfriend is possibly suicidal -- been depressed for years.Hey guys. I met my boyfriend (I'm a guy, btw) in March, and we've been getting along great. The more I get to know him, however, the more he's letting me know about his past. To be short, I'll say he went to a hardcore Christian school that forced him to suppress his sexuality and his gender identity for years, all the way through high school. Now that he's a year out of there, it's starting to come back to him. 

There have been many nights where I have held him for quite a while while he cried and told me rather horrible things that his peers would tell him and how callous all of his teachers were. He feels like he has no friends (he pretty much doesn't) and his relationship with his parents is shaky at best. Almost everyone he took for a friend has betrayed him or won't accept his personality. He really is the nicest, sweetest guy I've ever met, and it's not fair.

Worst of all, he let slip that he was feeling suicidal in a conversation a couple days ago. He denied it outright when I pressed him for the truth, but the other day I caught him in the bathtub doing what I think was trying to drown himself (good thing that doesn't work). I don't think he'll actually pull it off, but it worries me a lot.

I've been there for him in the ways I can think of: re-enforcing that he's a great person, trying to expose the irrationality of his peers, taking his side on pretty much everything (and most of the time I agree with him). He's also been taking little steps to help himself (deleting his facebook, shutting out so-called friends, trying to reconnect with his parents).

But well my biggest fear is the second oldest cousin. Here is a short description of him: he is almost two metres tall, blonde hair (probably early balding üíÄ), blue eyes and has a beginning dad body at age 21. Well it started at my birth he was pretty normal and acted like decent human being, but when he started going to puberty everything changed he started  bullying me and I really started to get crazy because of him. But when I reached the age of ten he started to act normal and even decent again.

But more it started to get back downwards when his parents divorced. His mother really fears him he calls her mean names and wakes her up midnight after going out, but gladly she got protect by his younger brother and his girlfriend. He had also had a lot of girlfriends before and his current one is the best of them, because she can handle him and his disrespectful behaviour eventhough he is sometimes sexist towards her and actually like her and hope she teaches him some lessons.

He is one of the much main reasons I never go to birthday parties again. The first time he saw me after I came out as trans he started acting straight up creepy and controlling (like always) towards me and got kinda mad about the fact that there was a man in my life at that time. He wanted to know everything about him and even read our conversations about sleeping and hiking... And started talking about things I should go to horny jail for while mentioning here. The last time I saw him he was with his girlfriend and his younger brother at my grandpa's house, he didn't a lot of stupid things, but I was still kinda mad about the facts that he shared my and his brother's baby photos with his girlfriend.

It seems as if I have reached the end of a very long tunnel, a rock bottom.
I have suffered from depression for years, but never has it been this bad. I am healthy, am surrounded by people who love me, and am at a great university, yet the thought of getting out of bed each day is unbearable. 
Every interaction with another human leaves me wondering if they hate me. I can‚Äôt see why they would like me, and I try to convince myself otherwise but it is impossible. I am disgusted with my body, my embarrassing personality, or my lack thereof.
I am a shell of my former self. I crave love but I will never allow myself to feel. I get blackout drunk every Friday and Saturday because the only way to ease the pain is to not remember it. I suffer from DP/DR, which makes like a living hell and leaves me begging to live a life in which I can believe is real. 
And so ends a simple story. A desperation, longing for some sort of comfort maybe. My mind is empty yet racing.

Where to fucking begin. So this kid is just a grade A asshole. He treats everyone like shit and dear god, he‚Äôs so goddamn annoying! I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm hated by a lot of people at my school (but those people I want nothing to do with so I‚Äôm good at this point). But this kid to even the people who I don‚Äôt like, they hate him, more than me. This dude acts like he‚Äôs the only perfect person on the campus and he tries to call people out (most notably me). He acts like everyone just has this flaw and that they‚Äôre a terrible person and he‚Äôs the guardian angel but in reality he just makes things worse.

For example he tried to sell me something the other day and I originally said yes but then I back out (I will not clarify what he sold me it wasn‚Äôt drugs or anything but I don‚Äôt want him to find me (and backing out was a dick move on my part)). But then he just railed into me the other day and he banned me from a club and called me a terrible person and how I‚Äôm the worst person to ever grace the planet earth. At the end I wasn‚Äôt even mad at what he said, I‚Äôve been hurt so much by this piece of shit I don‚Äôt feel anything anymore. And the club he banned me from (he was a high ranking person) and his words were ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt like dicks in our club‚Äù well if he doesn‚Äôt like dicks in that club then he shouldn‚Äôt be president. (I‚Äôll bring up what he said later).

But this guy just doesn‚Äôt know when to catch a break. Freshman year was by far the worst year of school I‚Äôve had period. I was struggling with identity and was that cringy guy who was an edgy attention seeker, I made threats, I did stupid things. (and looking back on it A. I‚Äôve come a long way, B. I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not that person anymore, and C. I‚Äôm very embarrassed by it and nobody‚Äôs gonna let me forget it). I also lost my grandmother that year and my social life was a giant mess. But this fucker just doesn‚Äôt let up, he‚Äôs making fun of me, bullying me and I just wanted it to stop and he wouldn‚Äôt stop. It was pure agony, I just begged and just wanted him to stop but he just wouldn‚Äôt shut his fucking mouth.

So now where here back to what he sent me. He sent me a discord DM about how shitty of person I was and that I should feel ashamed of just existing. So my rebuttal was about 60% of this rant, I told him what was happening and how he‚Äôs the root cause of it all (tbh he was). And he didn‚Äôt believe a word of what I said, which led me to realize something: he‚Äôs the fucking moron the entire time. He plays the person who‚Äôs enforcing all this hatred on people like it‚Äôs his god given mission. And he doesn‚Äôt realize that‚Äôs he‚Äôs the problem. What I told him was genuinely true. I know drama, I‚Äôm a theater kid for crying out loud. And he was saying that everything I do is worthless (that‚Äôs how I interpreted it). 

And tbh I‚Äôm finally content with myself, I‚Äôve accepted myself (kinda there‚Äôs one loose end). And I‚Äôm not going to let some piece of shit, sorry and embarrassing excuse of a human being out me down. I hope that satan has a seat with his name on it.

For far too long I have been dealing with multiple mental health issues - chronic depression, anxiety, complex PTSD, ASD, inferiority complex, and maybe more which I may not be aware of. I'm nearly 30 years old, raised by narcissistic parents; my father was physically and mentally abusive, while my mother was emotionally abusive and would guilt-trip me whenever I showed any signs of feeling depressed. Everything was always my fault, even if I had no direct (or indirect) involvement. I was always bullied at school by anyone and everyone, and even with blatant evidence to prove my innocence, teachers/staff members would always deem me as problematic. I am mostly remembered by my school peers as the one who tried to kill himself during the first year - even the teachers made suicide jokes at my expense, and other students were often encouraged/rewarded for bullying me.

&amp;#x200B;

College proved no better. I was harshly betrayed by my peers and cheated out of a decent grade by the end of my course. The lecturers we had denounced my mental health issues and insisted that I was just seeking their sympathy. It didn't help that I was also struggling with my sexuality at this stage, and experienced the stigma and harassment that accompanied being anything but heterosexual. Around this time, I was also becoming more isolated from my peers at a local youth group at a nearby church - because of the issues with my sexual identity, the domestic issues with my family, and my sheer unhappiness in life, more and more people started to shun me until I no longer felt welcome. I even went to a different church, but ultimately things weren't much better, and my weight/size became the subject of bullying.

&amp;#x200B;

Later in life, I was face with restrictions on what I wanted to do with myself in terms of further education, career, where I called home...my naivety would ultimately be my downfall as I foolishly listening to my parents about not moving away and staying put. I missed out on life skills that I so desperately wanted to experience, to the point where I no longer feel like my mental age reflects my actual age. My brother, who had it much worse than me, was able to make a name for himself; he was able to bear children, regardless of how many relationships he had, but has now settled down, has a place of his own, has a stable job and is able to support his life-long hobby of wrestling.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't  been in a relationship for 13 years now. Since my last relationship, the only people who have been interested in me were only interested in money, soliciting images of myself, or used me as a means of getting to someone else. There are three exceptions: one person was interested in sex and attempted to sexually assault me, one was only interested in gaining a visa to migrate to the UK and made it clear I was going to be a stay-at-home partner with no contact with friends or family, and a third was also just interested in sex and made it very clear he wouldn't accept no as an answer. That said, I am far from being even conventionally attractive, moreso by today's standards. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even get accepted by my workk colleagues. While my job was the only thing keeping me alive with a decent wage, too much has been revealed about myself for me to be seen as anything but the weird one. Even my birthdays harbor nothing but ill-will. No one wants to spend time with me, and I only seem to attract nothing but trouble. My birthday is in two weeks, and by some sheer miracle my friend has let me visit him for the week. But upon my return, that's when I plan to carry out my suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to be a burden to anyone any longer. For far too long I've been accused of lying about my mental health, or being selfish and not thinking of others. But really, the people who I am supposed to be living for are mostly the ones who have left me feeling this way to begin with. I am exhausted, my will to live for myself has long since perished, and the one person who I was living for...through no fault of his own, I don't think I can carry on living even for him, my best friend.

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone who has actually read through this; please know that there is obviously a lot more to what I've mentioned that what I've revealed. Please do not message me asking me to reconsider; I have spend 20 years doing exactly that, I think I've thought it over enough times. Mental health services have failed me numerous times in the past, I no longer have faith in anything, so please do not waste your time sending me links or contact numbers. Also, I noticed that there are trolls who are sending pro-suicide messages to people...to you guys, I say don't even bother; I have likely already heard some variation of whatever it is you send to people, and probably worse, in person. Nothing you send in writing will top it.

My job requires long hours, my wife is bi-polar and doesn‚Äôt get along with my side of the family among other things and our sex life isn‚Äôt that great. Having said that we took a little time off to be separated. We are still married though. During that time for some reason I e-mailed an ex of mine just to say hi or see what was up or whatever. Anyway, she responded quickly and she told me that she has news I may or may not want to hear. I asked what is it, and she said that she had a daughter and she wasn‚Äôt sure but it may have been mine.  The dates lined up. She sent me a picture and honestly I didn‚Äôt see a resemblance to me. I only say this bc my daughter is damn near a spitting image of me.  I asked her what she wanted from me and she said nothing. She said she herself didn‚Äôt know for sure who the father was. The child is now 17. I basically freaked out. On top of all of that this  e-mail conversation all happened on Christmas Eve.  I had 0% knowledge of any of this before that day. This was a few years ago and I‚Äôve never followed up on this bc of the hurt I feel and the mental well being of my house.

I used to have a fair amount of friends, but people move on and I can't talk to them anymore. They talk about what they're doing with their lives: their jobs or courses at uni and the new things they're doing and the lives their living and they ask about me and there's nothing I can say, I've spent the last couple of years alone at my parents, eating and vomiting over and over again. I'm being discharged from out patients soon where I receive therapy, they said I'm making no progress, it's pointless, there's no where else they can refer me. 

I can't describe this feeling, it's overwhelming. I'm terrified. I overdosed before and collapsed and spent a night in hospital and I can't do that again, it was embarrassing and painful.  I need to end this properly, I'm stuck and I want it to stop I want to die so so much but I'm scared. It's so painful, everyone is moving on but I can't get past this. I'm just a burden on my family, all I do is upset them and it pains me everyday I think it'd hurt them at first if I died but surely that's better than going on and on like this.

210902,"The Game of LifeThere comes a time where you keep losing to this boss enemy. You don't give up immediately because you genuinely enjoy playing the game. But after 20 attempts, you begin to get frustrated and lose hope. You leave the game but intend to return afterwards. You seek help, checking forums and asking others for tips and advice. A few days later, you return to the game with new-found knowledge and renewed confidence. Yet, you still can't execute the moves and after another 10 attempts, you give up again. You fall into despair and lose all hope with progressing the game.

Then, someone noticed and decided to party up with you. Together, you guys took down the boss and you finally got to the next stage. But deep down inside, you have no sense of accomplishment because someone had to hold your hand and walk you through the boss stage. Furthermore, the enemies in the next stage are tougher but should have been manageable IF you had picked up the necessary skills and defeated the boss on your own like everyone else.

Somehow someway, you managed to drag yourself to the next boss and oh boy it's a tough one. You got completely rekt at your first attempt and it's beginning to look like a joke. Similarly, you sought advice elsewhere only to no avail. You found someone else to party with and once again, defeated the boss with their help. And the cycle repeats as you face even stronger creeps and struggle every step of the game.

You realise that this vicious cycle is just going to continue forever. You are severely under-leveled and you understand that seeking help all the time will just further screw you over.

 When I got into my next school (fifth grade) it only got worse. I was raised to be always nice to everyone, doesn't matter who, but I think this was a mistake. I still follow this rule. I am nice to my bullies because I am afraid of the consequences. But not even the teachers can do anything about it, because they know that the bullying will stop for only a week.
I am chronically ill and sometimes can't do PE with the others. And one guy told me that I just made that illness up so I wouldn't have to run and could continue to be a 'fat cunt'. That was it for me. I couldn't control my emotions and just burst out crying. No one was caring for me. Everyone was laughing. I  was done. He was the also the one to tell me I needed therapy because I was 'too emotional'. Fuck you too.

I dropped a very obvious hint in our class group chat that I was gonna kill myself, and only one boy tried to talk me out of it, but with the typical shit like 'so much to live for' or 'you can do so many things with your education' yeah, sure.

Also someone that I believed to be my friend has also started bullying me. I can't fucking live with this shit and pain anymore.

All the bullies tell me that I am worth nothing and that I only exist so that they can take out their miserable lives on me. I love to draw, and I know I am definitely not the best, but I am also not that bad at it in my opinion. But apparently everything I post on my Instagram or draw in school is 'shit and ugly and should absolutely be burned'

Nobody cares for me. Nobody loves me. So nobody will care if I'm dead. Maybe except the bullies because they will have to look for someone else now. I fucking hate it. I just can't anymore.",suicide

129230,"Checkmate.I'm writing this mostly just for the sake of writing it down. Someone adviced me to do it here, so that people might actually read it. Nobody knows any of this. I actually don't really wan't anybody to any of this, but let's just say thank god for the anonimity of the internet. I've left some specific details ambiguous for private reasons but it doesn't impact the story in any way.

So I'll begin with saying that I hate sob stories. Absolutely hate 'em and now I hate myself for writing one. This my first attempt at Reddit, seeing as it is something I'd like to know people's thoughts on and this subreddit seems fairly active so here goes.
I'm a 20 year old male living in Europe (therefore please excuse my often incorrect English). I recently dropped out of university (or college whatever) because teaching history didn't turn out te be what I wanted to with my life after all. Throughout all my life I never truly felt happy. For a number of reasons -- my parents divorced when I was 2 years old. This wasn't really bad as I was far too young and dumb back then to get any of that shit. Things got worse when my mom got this alcoholic asshole boyfriend who used to hit her and me. This and some trouble at elementary school eventually forced me to live away from when I was 7 years old until I was about 14-15. During that period I had some better days - I had a lot of friends, people invited me to parties all the time, the girls liked me, I played in a band - it was generally just a nice time. But a lot of the time I still felt lonely. Because I'm not exactly a 'normal' person with 'normal' opinions and interests. I'm the type of guy who laughs when he watches an ISIS beheading vid. I hate children. I fucking hate the monsters. I root for the bad guys in the movies. I think lying is always justifiable. I don't support racism because I think it's right or if it has any factual basis but I do find it soooo funny. I laugh at rape jokes, I laugh at dead baby jokes, I laugh at gore. When I see child in the street get catapulted off his bike, I laugh. I think war is good and that the world needs another good one. I don't think killing is is bad as long as you got a reason that's valid to yourself and your smart enough to get away with it. My main interests are massacres and human experiments commited during WW2, thermonuclear warfare and poisonous plants. As you can see, to most people I'm not a very likeable person. Some of you might argue that a person like that deserves to feel the way the way I do; but in any case, I hope it's clear why I never could relate to anyone or anything real. I started feeling really bad: just very lonely at first, later came anxiety until I hade full blown panic attacks for no reason at all. I started cutting myself at some point and never really kicked the habit. I tried getting help for it and got a bunch of diagnoses and perscription meds but none of it really worked. I got scared of myself sometimes. And the worst thing was that I didn't have anybody to discuss these feelings with at all, because nobody understood any of it. I didn't think there was but a single person in the world like me. Somehow I resigned myself to that fate. Being unique isn't all that bad, I thought. I didn't think I'd ever have a wife or a family of my own because there wasn't anybody in the world who I'd like to spend my life with. I never really 'loved' anyone. Sure I had girlfriends, and I 'liked' them, I thought they were sweet and interesting, but I never really loved them. They were always too naive, or boring or in some other way just... disappointing. But I didn't really care about that. Some people just aren't meant for that, I thought. So I just lived like that for a time not expecting anything to come my way at all and basically just drinking my days away whenever I didn't have a job to do or something like that. Now we're getting to the really pathetic part. I met a girl. Fucking online. I fucking hate the idea of meeting people online (not on a dating site or any of that cringeworthy kind of shit, god forbid), it sounded to me like total bullshit -- to take in interest in somebody you haven't really met at all in your life. Like I was some desperate fuck. But she was all  I'd really want: she was smart, in fact the only person whom I regard to be as smart as myself, and yes I can proudly say I'm arrogant like that; she likes the same things I do. She has the same general outlook on life that I do. We've just got so many things in common. And she is absolutely 100% batshit insane. Just the way I want to be. Most of you probably think to know where this is going. That it's going to be another broken-heart sob tale, but not quiet. It's not what makes it all that bad to me. You see, when I met her, and started talking to her I gradually fell madly in love with her. I haven't seen her once with my own eyes, never even heard her voice but I knew from those very first moments that if there was ever a person who I'd like to share a life with, it'd been her. But there was a complication. She lived a half a world away. I took this rather hard, I never told her what I felt for her because I didn't see any point in it: the chances of me ever meeting her were negligible. Until she asked my about my country because she said that she's going to move here before this year is out. My heart skipped a beat. I thought this was some kind of divine miracle. I actually thought that this was a chance at finding some degree of happiness  in life. But, sadly, things that seem to be too good to be true usually are just that. Good old FB was so kind as to smash into my face the nice notification that she's engaged to some other guy. I was stupid. Why else would she cross half the world to come to this rather shitty country that I live in? I was naive. I should've known. And still it broke something inside of me. It's not that I'm that jealous a person, sure it plays a part but that's definately not all of it. It's the combination of the cruel fact that the only person I ever think I'll love is coming all over the world to what is virtually right  around the next corner for me to be with someone else. The irony that I felt when I saw it was downright lethal. I knew not whether I should cry or laugh so I did both. I never believed in 'justice'. I think it's just some made up word that gives some people some consolation now and again when they feel they've been wronged. Yet, at that moment, all I could think of was how unfair it all was. What makes it worse that I cannot bring myself to hate the other guy, because she makes him happy and I wouldn't ever do anything to hurt her. But this reaffirmation of my feelings towards on account of the fact that I can't hate him doesn't make it any easier to bear. It all just feels like a checkmate -- no matter where you want to move to, the path is blocked. And this is not some passing fancy. I've thought this true. A lot. She really is what I want in this world. The only thing. I'd happily give my entire life to have her for just one day. Hell, a minute would suffice. (none of you have any idea how disgusted I am at myself for writing this pathetic kind of shit). Almost every thought I have, is of her. When I close my eyes I see her face, even though I've never seen it IRL. I cannot bring myself to do anything anymore. I sleep most of the day by taking (too many) benzodiapine type medications. When I'm awake I drink until I can't exactly call myself conscious anymore and stumble off to bed to sleep for the next 16-18 hours. Nothing interests me anymore. I can no longer bring myself to watch a movie, every little gesture of affection just sents daggers through my heart, I don't want to play video games, I don't wan't too listen to music, I don't play the guitar anymore, I barely eat, sometimes I try to read a book but I can't concentrate. Writing this is the only sustained effort I've undertaken in the past few days. It felt like a aged 50 years in the space of a month. I really don't feel 20. I feel literally, physically weighed down by everything. Beside all this, I have some problems at home after I dropped out of school, both my parents struggle with their mental illnesses, and mine. My mom can't take it if I'm feeling bad because the poor thing will start feeling even worse herself so I really can't talk to her about it. It would devastate her. And my dad's an asshole. End of story. Besides, social services in my country have told me I won't be getting a job until I have some psychiatric issues checked out (unrelated to these). College isn't really a possibility anymore as my dad has cut all funding for my education. And on top of all that I have this agony. I actually find myself hoping there is a god so I would have someone to blame it all one. It's easy to start blaming everyone when there's no one to blame. So I've sat down and really thought about it all and come to the conclusion that I don't want it. It's not something I came up with the day before yesterday and am now writing about in the hope somebody may read this and have some wonderful piece of advice to talk me out of it. I've thought about this very carefully and deliberately. I compared every possible scenario and possibility, judging some of it on rational probability and other things on the way I felt. Regardless of how it all could be, I don't want any of it. I will not see her coming so close to me only to be with someone else. I won't bear it, I don't want to bear it. Moving away from here isn't an option for practical reasons. I've thought a lot about what it would to my family -- my mom would take it hard at first but I think she'd understand it in the end. She loves me as a son but she really doesn't like me as a person. My dad would definately get over it. Asshole's told me as much. Therefore, I want to have it over and done with before this year's out. Before she moves here. I don't want to see my 21st birthday. I feel to old already. As I said before: this is not just another broken heart bawwing tale that will probably pass in a month. I have been feeling like this for quite some time and I don't think all the stars in the sky could fill the whole she left behind. I just want to go to sleep one night, dream of her, and not have to wake up again. That's all I want. I won't live my life torturing myself, waiting for some miracle that isn't coming. I was a fool to believe that anything was ever going to come my way, except for delicious melancholic irony. The irony really is the worst of it all. So that's the long and short of it. I'd like to know is there anybody who can even remotely relate to this kind of vice I'm in? Do you think this is a valid reason to consider suicide? To desire something or somebody above all else in this world, something you'd not just kill for but die for to have for just a minute, but still can't have and never will?
And if so, do you have any advice how I could explain this to my mother?                  ",suicide

I failed the university preparation course, but got let in anyway because I'm 20. I'm on academic risk, so I'm only doing class on Wednesday &amp; Friday. Even more, it is a creative media production degree. No idea if it'll be worth it or I'm just giving myself a debt and shooting myself in the foot.

During that course, my only friends were online. It was in a group where you can post anything you want, and every month there is a vote on who to kick. I felt like this made people kicked based on unpopular opinion, so I made a blog where anyone can post anything anonymously. It was just full of insults, and they voted me out. Ironically, it was just the same content they post about other people but instead at their expense now because it is anonymous. 

Now I keep being targeted online and posts about me blasted to this group. It keeps stressing on my mind much more than it should. This is high-school level shit among manchildren who were never cool in high school, so everyone plays the popularity game online now.

92314,"Tried talking to mother...24 year old female. Long story short... my grandmother (who basically raised me) passed away in October. Due to being a college grad but sucky economy I had to move out of my grandmothers home (who I lived with) back into my mothers home. Things have been literal hell, she fusses about me and my dog 24/7 vacuums three times a day due to my dog and doesn‚Äôt allow me to touch any cleaning supplies, kitchen area, or laundry room due to me ‚Äúbeing messy‚Äù I‚Äôm not allowed to lay on the couch or anything because ‚ÄúI‚Äôll damage it‚Äù. So therefore I spend  all day in my little room when I‚Äôm not at work or grad school. 

I‚Äôm just done. I honestly hate coming home and find myself driving to a parking lot and just sitting in my car to avoid going home. I often talk about moving out to which my mom response is ‚ÄúIf you leave this house before your get your masters degree, you‚Äôll be exiled from the family and I‚Äôll never talk to you again, you can‚Äôt manage it on your own‚Äù

129723,"Just got threatened while riding my bike because I was wearing my dad's old police hat.... Context my father was a patrol cop/hostage negotiater for 4 years he retired before I was born and got a different job. So decided since it was raining that I was going to wear a hat, since I was a kid it's been my dream to become a cop like my dad was not for any thing else besides my dad's pride that he knew that I would carry on his legacy. So let's come back to the present. I grabbed a hat off the rack and i picked my dad's old police cap, got my mask, and headed off to the garage to get my bike and go excersise fast forward a couple minutes later i got about a street down before a couple who I was guessing were on a walk too even though it was raining (guess they like the rain as much as I do) and yelled at me and I know I heard the words perfectly ""you trump suporting bitch"" and this couple must've been as old as 20-25, now believe me I don't like Trump as much as the next guy I think he's a horrible person but still just because I like the police doesn't mean I support trump it's just you have to remember not all police are bad, they keep drugs off the street, they arest women abuser's and rapists, they also keep guns off the street so you or your neighbor don't get shot. So let's come back I heard the words and I just decided to ignor them and keep riding I get about 5 blocks down and then I hear the words ""I swear I'll find out were you live"" from the man and at this point I'm scared because these people look like the people who will do it and they were close enough to probably follow me home so I just book it home so they don't have enough time to try and figure out were I'm going and then just go straight into the garage (that I kept open because I forgot to close it with my phone) and guessing that my dad would close it and then I just look behind me just to make sure that they weren't following me and slammed the door. Then told my parents what happened needless to say that I won't be going on bike rides for a while until things cool down. Moral of the story is be careful and wear a mask and be careful.

I developed OCD and anxiety, I had constant fear of burglaries to the point that I didn't feel safe in my own home. When I was young, I used to have mental breakdowns when my family tried to make me go out because I was ugly, I was fat and I was a monster. 

Domestic violence was a big thing in my house - I still shake, sweat and I can feel my heart drop whenever I hear loud banging from another room.

Every night I lay in bed trying to get to sleep with every unhappy thought in my head, all the thoughts are so disjointed, unclear, as if I can't think properly. 

The only clear thing is that these thoughts are quite literally overwhelming. Every night I resolve to kill myself in the morning. 

Then it's morning. It's not that having slept on it things are better, it's more that I've come down from being past the point of being able to cope to just on the edge of my capability to cope. I go through my awful day, it's evening again and the whole process starts again

One day sooner or later, I feel like sooner, I won't wake up like that. I'll wake up still committed to the idea of killing myself. 

I cannot remember ever being happy or even just okay. I'm 25 now and I can remember crushing unhappiness going back at least to when I was 15. When I was in school I could look to the idea of 'I'll go to university and things will be different, I'll meet new friends, it'll be a new start'. When I was at university and that obviously didn't work out I could think the same about finishing university. Now though there is next stage to look forward to and even if there was I know it'd end up being no better.  Life now is deciding to kill myself in the evenings, deciding against that in the mornings until one day I don't. 

I have nothing good in my life. I have no real friends (and no clue on how to make them), I've never had a meaningful relationship (It's quite difficult letting people close when like this), even my family don't like me that much (the feeling is mutual). Sure I've got a job, but the thought of going to my workplace every day makes me feel physically ill and it's a dead end job that's going nowhere.

He is, and this is where the cliche stuff comes in, an organist for a local church. He only comes over when he's extremely drunk. Only when he wants sex and when he does come over he rarely spends the night. I'm in my 30s and even though I've had boyfriends before I've never bottomed for anyone else. It's the one thing I was saving for someone and I've given it to him. Sometimes he is open about his life and sometimes he is very guarded. We both have ill mothers who are very much a part of our lives and who we are. His mother is dying of cancer brought on by alcoholism. My mother is mentally ill and chronically relapses into schizophrenia and I and my father are both alcoholics. He tells me that people around here that are openly gay ""get lynched"". He is so terrified even though everyone really knows. He tells me that I don't really know what love is. If I wasn't so in love with him I would just give up and try to find someone else.

""tried"". i locked myself in the bathroom with a sharp razor and cried until i pussied out. last night i had to accept that no one will ever love me the way i love them, and that is a disturbing thing for me to keep inside. i don't have friends, i don't have people in my classes, my parents don't trust me.
no one trusts me. i'm very ready to die. i'm thinking of the train by my home often, or dying in the bathtub. i just don't know anymore. i can't eat or sleep. when i have no one, there is nothing to live for, and when i have someone, instead of wanting to live i feel like i have a million more reasons to kill myself. i don't care if i hurt people with my suicide either... i hurt so many people living, i don't even care. i can't! if i die i'm doing this world a good favor.

151267,"There is truly no reason to not do itEver since I first started serious ideations a few years back, I've drifted in and out of phases of intense, mind-altering phases of sadness (such that I was so sick and selfish that I can't stomach the mindspace I had), and more 'stagnant' periods of normalcy and calm where my sadness is a bit more null. 

Throughout these years, I've read hundreds, if not thousands of literature from older times to the now on the the act. I may not know fully, but I have an idea: of the moments of clarity and cognizance moments or seconds before the act that might be life-altering for some; of essays about life and regret and sometimes, intent to die of lovely people who have lied and their counterparts; of notes that we have to blanket in metaphor, or others that look more like justifications and sets of instructions from the departed; of strange stories like the Egg that weave religion and pride into some sort of attempt to share that to feel empathy for people and not be a piece of shit that you must think everyone is some form of yourself; to falling in love with music, film, and literature that I might see myself in‚Äìor maybe not at all‚Äìmaking me more aware of the nuances of life and the lessons that we've learned of human history; of psychology or the nulled feelings that the people who clean up after us must feel, to the profiteers off human suffering to the humans forced to stomach through thousands of these images day to day.

When any of these stories or literature point to the act of suicide, there really aren't any revelations. All the reasons to do so are in the same in some sense (how different can our suffering really be when we're all here?), and all the reasons to not are, too. The arguments and words for the latter are particularly terrible sometimes, whether they're infused with religion or not, or offer me numbers and hotlines or points of reflection to times when I was theoretically more happy or loved that may have happened or may still come.

I'm still ridiculously young, but I'm coming to understand that in the end of all things: there is no truly no reason to not do it. These are more naive thoughts: but everyone around me would have seen it coming anyway. Like in hundreds of these narratives, I also used to find it interesting to imagine what life would be like after I died, the aftereffects of it all, and I used to find pleasure in the thought that people would miss me and missed the chance to appreciate me‚Äìor in most other times, was heartbroken by the (maybe) visceral sadness for a while, but the later healing and perhaps even understanding that would come.  
Now, I'm not really interested in the afterdeath scenario. I know what is likely to happen, just as I know what's likely to happen if I continue on living: that the things that happen to us come in waves, that the world is truly unjust and what we make of it, that I am living in one of the most exciting yet fearful times and am endlessly grateful for at least being born on the side of privilege.

But in the end, there's no reason to not do it. This is not because I don't understand how the people around me feel, this is not because I don't feel particularly loved now or don't believe that I could find a support system in life if I needed one. But there's this crushing weight of the world and its systems, of how I've went offtrack in life and would much rather just give myself some form of peace for once‚Äìfor the first time‚Äìafter having tried to understand, see, experience, and also do a bit better for it.

And I've talked to so many people. And I've been open about this and so, so ridiculously empty beyond anything. I am not beyond salvation: I do not see a need to be saved, rescued, or talked out of it. This is just a constant feeling that lingers whether it's the best day of my life so far (you know, when things are suddenly so good they don't feel real, or when you're just happy and satisfied with what's been going on?) or when something not-so-good happens. And I know it's not entirely rational, and so are the words of the people trying to save or trying to justify their deaths from beyond: but is anything, at all?

Most people talk about bliss before the act. A sudden shift in mood. Or the anger and the doneness of complacency. Whatever I feel tonight is irrelevant. What matters only is the action.",suicide

Their lab group were talking about what they did on their weekend, and my friend (Mike) said he was playing with his new butterfly knife, doing tricks and stuff. She said, ""I do something like that"" and showed Mike her wrists, which had obvious self-harm scars. We found out that she is kinda poor and her parents don't really care about her, as last year they forgot her birthday. Not the date, on her birthday they were clueless.

I‚Äôm currently 17, and I don‚Äôt feel like living anymore. I fuck up my family‚Äôs life. They feel like I‚Äôm a huge failure. I know they do. Since secondary school, my grades are worthless. Since secondary school, I have very small social life. I feel like dead weight to everyone. I ran away from home twice, and both times I had to come back because I had no money and I was too young to be outside ‚Äúlegally‚Äù. I live under the same roof with my parents, and I never see my father(I don‚Äôt like him so I don‚Äôt care, it was just to give you a picture of my situation).  I tried ending it all a twice, I would never go through with it because I‚Äôm too much of a bitch to endure the physical pain it brings. I genuinely don‚Äôt give a fuck about what the family thinks about me, I despise them as much as they despise me. No one actually likes me. And guess what, it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm fucking ugly, I actually like how I am. Sometimes, I would think about myself just walking down a road and getting shot in the back of the head without knowing it, I hope it happens. 

My father told me:‚ÄùWhat has he done to god(which he doesn‚Äôt even believe in) to have such a shitty kid.‚Äù Back when we still talked he reminded me everyday of the failure I am,  compares to cousins that went to oxford or some other elite university, tells everyone in the family what kind of bullshit person I became. He also called me names but I don‚Äôt care about that. Fuck him and his entire line of ancestors. If we were still in a time where killers got off easily, he would be fucking dead. No one cares, the rest of my family either tell him to get rid of me or do nothing.
My mother, who is with my father for cash, told me to stop my bullshit if not she would not take care of me and let him kick me out(I was like 14-15). 
Honestly, if I couldn‚Äôt feel the pain I probably would not be writing this now, I‚Äôd probably be dead somewhere no one can find and be declared a missing person, or something like that.

Well after all that, basically I showed the video to her friend and she said it was really good, but my ex-crush said she would sue me. Toxic bullshit. She just said that because she hated me but she wasn‚Äôt going to pull through. Empty threats.

Everybody told me to avoid it, you know. Avoid anything and everything that reminded me of her, to focus on myself, to not feel bad about it... because at the end of the day all those people said the same thing; that it wasn‚Äôt my fault.

Of course having the stubborn mind of a 17 year old, I didn‚Äôt listen. My obsession with this girl just drew me into wanting closure, one last talk‚Äî because that‚Äôs the best way to end it all for good, right? Ahaha.. all of yesterday, just constant struggle between my own two halves, one wanting to drop ALL that baggage like everyone said, the other part of me at its limit wanting to hold onto that human being as hard as it possibly could.

One where I tell us to make up. One where I say to her ‚ÄúThis is ridiculous. I even made a video to entertain you.‚Äù One where I say ‚ÄúThis happened a year ago. Let‚Äôs just make up and let go.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur situation was really stupid.‚Äù One where I was nearly in tears, and ranted about how dumb it is to say that just because I‚Äôm a guy that I deserve all of those hostile terms that she said to me.

‚ÄúPlease grow up...‚Äù was the last thing I said.

Not a word. No reply. After four minutes, she just blocked the phone number.

...

It‚Äôs finally time.

That darkness and unkindness in her heart just leaves me with an empty anxiety.

I think that now, as a reflection of everything that occurred... I‚Äôd go as far as to say that no matter how much a girl mistreats me, 

I will never be treated as bad as that woman treated me. 

Unless it‚Äôs my wife, I will never experience as much stress with another woman again as much as I did with that woman.

Im 19 and im in university right now. Before i joined highschool i already had a year where i had a depression and tried to kill myself (i guess my stupidity back then saved me) 

Im afraid of the depression and that it could be coming back... i dont know how to stop the feeling... at night its the worst 
I want the thought to go away but it doesnt and im making pressure because i cant be tired for university 

It feels like it started when we had to hand in exercices which were graded
We have to do a block of those in our first year and its possible to do them in all 4 areas of the swiss law and its the first one so actually it isnt so bad

And since my friends from highschool didnt join the uni with me i feel lonely
Ive found new friends here but it isnt the same 

I keep telling myself that the suicidal thoughts are dumb and it doesnt make any sense but i cant get rid of them i dont wanna go back to depression

I dont wanna speak with my family about it because theyre already under pressure and i dont want to strain them

Sometimes i feel like the only thing keeping me going is not wanting to hurt them
Im afraid of sobbing infront of them because that would alarm them or others 
It doesnt make any sense i always wanted to study law and its very interesting but since joining the uni its been going downhill
I know about suicide hotlines but i get up the courage to speak to them i just call and then hang up

At the same time it feels soothing to know that theres a way out... but i know that its wrong but i feel like pressuring me against the thoughts makes everything even worse
When i try to study i get into this downward spiral and the pressure makes everything worse... i try to keep it to myself but during the day its so hard to keep the emotions down so i keep feeling this pain in my stomach as if i was going to implode
I know that my brain is playing tricks on me but it feels so real i cant speak to anyone about this without breaking up into tears and making it obvious
This doesnt make any sense we dont have any financial issued, i like my studies but i havent been so sad for years
Theres this place next to the tracks in the woods
On the weekends theres a train even deep into the night so sometimes i just sit there to contemplate but im afraid of it hurting too much or not working and i dont wanna ruin the train drivers life just because im some depressive weird fuck 
Ive looked up on overdoses but we have very strict drug laws so i cant get any that would work apparently slashing the wrists takes too long

loneliness has put me through the worst depressions of my life. it sucks feeling like you have absolutely nobody that cares about you, but it sucks even more knowing that it‚Äôs completely true. it‚Äôs not even just relationships, i have never had a longterm group of friends, and i have dealt with multiple ‚Äúrejections‚Äù from friends who just cut me off and decided they didn‚Äôt like me anymore. back in high school when i couldn‚Äôt drive i spent every lunch period alone for two years. i felt so fucking pathetic every day. nobody fucking cared. i don‚Äôt know what the fuck i‚Äôm doing wrong. it‚Äôs so hard to live like this. if this is the way my whole life is going to be i might as well just end it now. i try so hard to be a loving and kind and funny person, and people have told me that i am those things, so why am i so alone always always always always

one time this girl told me i was smart for not dating anybody all throughout school. i laughed in the moment but that comment hurt so damn much. if i had the opportunity?? i would be dating left and right. i crave so much physical affection that i have never received. i cried again that day because it reminded me of how nobody wants me. i have spent hours in my bed sobbing about loneliness. life is too much for me to handle on my own. i feel like i have zero emotional outlets, and who would want to hear me cry about how i feel alone anyways. they don‚Äôt understand that i have genuinely felt this way my entire life. it hurts so bad. it‚Äôs not that i haven‚Äôt tried making the first move either. i talk to people, flirt with people, try to make new friends, but it is never reciprocated.

back in fall of last year, there actually was one guy who started to flirt with me. the problem was that he didn‚Äôt actually like me at all. he has tried to get with every fucking girl near him, so while he was ‚Äúflirting‚Äù with me, he was also flirting with girl 1, girl 2, girl 3, girl 4, etc at the exact same time. but of course i fucking fell in love with him at the first sign of affection because i thought i was somehow special.

he hurt me so fucking bad. i was not special at all. he was the first person in my entire life to show ANY kind of attraction to me but it wasn‚Äôt real. at all. i genuinely think this is going to ruin all of my future chances at a relationship. i can‚Äôt fathom anyone feeling attracted to me at all. if they are, it‚Äôs a fucking sick joke on me. i am completely and utterly alone. the same amount of alone as i was before this guy came and ruined any progress i was making on my self esteem. not exaggerating when i say i cried for 4 months straight after this happened.

the horrible thing is that he gets away with it. because every girl starts to get feelings for him because he gives them attention, and because he‚Äôs an attractive person. they think they‚Äôre special!! just like i did!! once the girls realize he‚Äôs a horrible person he cuts them off and moves on to the next girl. he‚Äôs already dating someone new that i KNOW feels the exact same way i thought i did. but he is not genuine. she is going to get hurt the same way i did. i want to scream and cry so hard. 

the only reason i care so much about what he does is because i still have feelings for him. i know he‚Äôs a horrible person, i know he doesn‚Äôt like me, i know he would be a bad partner, i know he would probably cheat on me once he found another girl, but my stupid fucking brain won‚Äôt let go of the little bit of attention he gave me 8 months ago. i still have feelings for him. because i‚Äôm so fucking alone. i fantasize about being in a relationship with him to help me feel less alone. but it only ever makes me feel worse. how can i be so unlovable that someone would just use me as a toy to flirt with so he can get other girls. i‚Äôm worried i‚Äôll never get over him. which is horrible to think about because we were never a thing in the first place. 

i don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. i don‚Äôt want to keep living like this. i‚Äôve read every article on what to do if you feel alone, but i‚Äôm sick of taking myself on dates and trying to meet new people and driving by myself for hours and hours just to distract myself and cry more.

i started a new job recently and i have no idea what i‚Äôm doing, it‚Äôs just a minimum wage retail job but thinking about going there makes me want to vomit from anxiety . i feel as though every person in the building despises me. i feel so completely alone in this world. i want everything to end. i have no one. i never will. i don‚Äôt feel like i deserve this. it‚Äôs getting so hard and i don‚Äôt know how much more i can take. but i would probably wait until i‚Äôm out of school, so nobody has to make an announcement to the school saying i fucking killed myself. how pathetic would that be. how selfish would that be. i want to do it so badly but i know i never will. i know it would hurt people.

how do i deal with living like this.",suicide

So My friends told my crush (F15) that I (M15) I was into her, We have been friends for along time and I was hoping that she would just pass it off. Fast forward 2 days and I walk into my biology class and To my surprise when I sat down in class she chose the seat next to me. (we are in a hybrid schedule and we both share a environmental bio class) The teacher told us to partner up with our table partner so me and her grouped up to work on or learning module. Were both pretty shy so for the first 10 min or so we didn't say much, then I decided to break the silence and ask her how her day was and we went back and forth from there. we started to talk about how are sperate live are going and while she was talking I tried not to look at her chest (she was wearing a somewhat reavling shirt) and over a period of time I started to get off... Then when I started to share, I mentioned how my uncle was arrested for something he didn't do and she tried to put her hand on my thigh as a comforting manner but I ended up turning to my side so I could face her and her hand landed on my crotch area. Immediately it fell silent and both of our faces were flushed red, neither of us moved for what felt like an hr (and yes that includes her hand...) After a while of use akwardly sitting there I started to feel her thumb move back and forth on my thing and the whole time I just sorta stared at my chromebook screen. And of course me being a guy and the girl who I have been falling for the last 2 years puts her hand on it, it got noticbly harder. So for the rest of the period she kept her hand there while I continued to work on our module.

Australia is just an elaborate cover up by the British government for a mass murder. Australia was founded as a penal colony that the prisoners were killed instead of sent to the nonexistent island, but England couldn‚Äôt admit that outright. I know this post will get deleted soon because they'll find out so copy this shit down and save it idk. Before the age of 13, we have no clue about this. We aren't taught about it etc. but from then on we're told the truth by a specialist that comes to school. Australia's population is FAKE. There are certain parts around the world that is where Australia actually is. There's a base in Miami, USA, one in Cape Town, Africa and another place (I forgot where, somewhere in Asia I think). Kangaroos are actually native to Africa, I think Koalas originate from China but I'm not sure. I'm currently 15. There are dedicated actors that are allowed to use the internet, but I'm not one of them. I don't even know how I passed the security password. Not everyone gets paid here, but we do have our own little towns that are blocked out and we can't escape, we get free food and clean water for all of our lives. There's a lot of riots but otherwise it's pretty safe. We're currently in a fake lockdown. There's no Coronavirus in here but we have to wear masks for the media. Australia's desert and landscape is shot in different parts of the world. ""Australia's"" landmarks are on the other side of the world. When tourists come to visit, they take them to a seperate, more free part of ""Australia"" which is Sydney. This is the largest part and most believable because of how big it is but there's massive borders outside the city that you can't pass from what I've heard. I'm in the Melbourne base which is located outside Cape Town. It's pretty small and on rare occasions we get to travel to other bases. We do have our own currency and we're always being tracked. We are actors and get paid in food and  euro in which we can actually order packages online from England. Currently listening to some great CDs.

Oh, I can see a house of red and white and brown,
some lights and a door, a lawn, a garden too
I see some run-down furniture that light the room 
Some hearts of ice, some weeds and rust of iron

Chorus:
Is this good-bye now, my Family
Farewell Family, adieu!
Must I leave you now, my Family
Will this be my last good-bye to you?

Verse:
Must I say good-bye to mum and Mary and Louise too
To Sophie and the cousins and to all the friends I knew
It was a family fight  and I'm too big to Patronise and scold
You slammed the door and left me here standing in the cold

Chorus:
Is this good-bye now, my Family 
Farewell Family, adieu!
Must I leave you now, my Family
Will this be my last good-bye to you?

Verse:
I've got my red flame ambition, my Mind of Mystery,
I've got my own young life that guide me
The love I cherished just isn't the one that I'm used to
You'll find the old one hiding there behind your broken bottle


Chorus:

I have been working so hard and trying to live, especially because I don't want to ruin my family's lives. I keep my guns really far way from me, if I didn't I would be at a major risk. I pay a lot to see a therapist maybe once a month and I can barely afford it, I have been trying antidepressants with not much success except screwing me up more but it's hard to tell. I work out a bit, I read CBT workbooks and am learning ways to change my mood. Trying to correct cognitive distortions on my own, trying to fix areas of my life where I am lacking like friends. I am trying and it is exhausting, I feel horrible despair often and anxiety attack every now and then. But I can get past some times now where previously it would ruin my entire day, I guess it's progress, I just don't know if I will get better than this. Getting better is already requiring me to completely change how I think entirely, change my self perception, my goals, how I spend time, everything, I will be a different person if I ever make it through.

If anyone has been here before, can you please explain what it was like for you? What were the major issues, what did you do to get past it? What was helpful, what do you wish you did differently? How is life now? Are you ever scare one day all your progress will fail and you will go back to being close to suicide?

Suicidal thoughts everyday. A few attempts this year.

Been dealing with having suicidal thoughts for a longer time now.

I have ""help"" since last year. 
I go to a place once a week and talk to someone (a nurse but she's on vacation now so there's someone else that'll be there)
Two people visit twice a week (one of them has vacation now and the other one will go on vacation in two weeks. not sure if anyone else will come here or i gotta wait until their vacation is over)
I've tried suicide chat lines.
I've called another number if i hadn't know what to do anymore (don't think feel calling them anymore either. it feels like i bother them and it usually ends up with them sending police or ambulance and i don't wanna deal with that)
The police know who i am now because of all the attempts that has happened this year. dunno what to think about that. the nurse told me this. (im just known by them because off that, nothing else)
I've started an investigation through the psychiatric hospital to see what kind of diagnosis i have. but gotta wait until August again for next meetings.
I try to stay alive and not take me own life since i don't wanna hurt my parents. they know im not doing well but they don't know about recent attempts or my self harm. 

What reality is, this doesn't help. im not really getting any ""help"" 
I go to the place and talk but it doesn't help and we haven't to be honest not done much. we've been waiting and waiting and waiting and the only thing I've been doing is waiting and not try to take my own life and been self harming on and off or everyday. 
Being admitted to the psych ward doesn't help, you're just stuck there staring so i can just be home staring as well. 
Medications hasn't helped. 
These people visiting doesn't help. 
Nothing is fun or enjoyable. 
Nothing makes me happy. at all. 
I can laugh and stuff but it's not ""real happiness"" 
I either feel empty/numb or too much/everything at the same time and i can't handle it. 
If i cry it doesn't feel real. i know i cry because im sad or whatever but it doesn't feel real. like real sadness. it feels like an empty dark void and i don't like it. 

I feel it would be better if i wasn't here. if i wasn't alive. if i was just dead. then i wouldn't be a bother or burden to anyone anymore. they wouldn't need to worry about some worthless and miserable person like me. everyone would be happier. 

The nurses, the people, my family etc. they wouldn't need to have me in their life anymore. they wouldn't need to worry anymore. they would be free of their pain they feel because of how i am doing.

But at the same time i know i would hurt them if i did this. 

But then again.. is it better for them to worry all the time and feel pain because of me. 

or is it better for them to get rid of their burden once and for all so they don't have to suffer anymore. 

There's not point anymore.
There really isn't. 

I only see darkness. 
I only see myself gone in the future. 

I'm sorry everyone.
That im such a mess that can't be fixed or helped.
Im sorry for being a burden on your shoulders.

I don't feel I'm in any immediate danger of attempting anything however, I am struggling to find a reason to keep pushing on.

Also, I'm barely handling my accountability for my actions in life so far. I can't unshoulder anything I've ever done wrong and I continue to torment myself with it like some necessary penance. I've done nothing, by many people's standards, too bad but to me it's crushing and I feel like I can't take an emotional breath amidst my grief and guilt. I was in a relationship with a really very nice, selfless, innocent and caring young lady that I had been friends with since school and we caused each other a great deal of emotional trauma. But I can't forgive myself, she's told me I can feel free of any guilt and that there's nothing to forgive but I can't accept it.¬†

This is only one example, I'm carrying everything with me and I don't know how to put any of it down. I'm experiencing total breakdown's every other night and the pain's getting unbearable. This coupled with a loss of any purpose and a job I don't want any more is causing me to have a hard time justifying sticking around. My friends say the good I do in people's lives is substantial and I thank them for all their kind words and thoughts, it's very fulfilling to see others happy about their lives being more manageable and closer to their dreams, but what have I got for myself?¬†


I feel like there are a lot of flaws in my thinking and that I'm missing a trick somewhere and there's certainly something I can do to help myself here but, I don't know what that is.¬†

The breakdown's aren't stopping and I'm struggling to find meaningful purpose for myself. I keep thinking I'm just waiting for death now and longing for my time to be up, but I can't help but feel I'm really looking for peace, how long before I can be at peace again?

I didn‚Äôt have friends until i met her. I didn‚Äôt understand people the way i could have. And because of this i ruined everything. I felt the need to always be there if the group was hanging out. I felt the need to always be in the party on PlayStation if she was on. These feelings were completely unjustified, and fueled by my anxiety and insecurity. I couldn‚Äôt help it. 

She was the only person who showed me genuine kindness. She genuinely cared for me. She was the first person I‚Äôve ever hungout with. We hungout all the time too, playing games together, going out to eat. Just enjoying eachothers company.

When will I finally leave all these good people alone so they get on with their lives? I don't deserve the few people that have stuck by me.

I don't know who can benefit from this post, I just hope some people can relate and I want to get my feelings off my chest to strangers. I am 21 years old and i have suffered from (self diagnosed) depression since i was 10. Life is like a big lie to me, i got stuck in the better side of it. I come from a broke family, i have two sisters and parents who dont work anymore. I always had to work for anything i wanted, new phones, clothes, list goes on and on. Finally after getting fired from my job on November last year, i realized that i will probably be working 9-5 with minimum wage for the rest of my life most likely, yeah this hurts me the most. I am a total failure, both of my sisters are committed to ivy league colleges and in reality even if i wanted to get to a college i doubt i would ever make it, i am just plain stupid, i am not book smart like them. I am just a disgrace. My parents probably dont expect anything from their only son anyway. This is just the truth. I used to be the brightest child in our family, but time goes on and people change and i have decided already that i am going kill myself and end this misery and do it in a way that anyone getting hurt. None of my friends probably know this side of me, but its all going to end this week. And if you made it this far reading my story, thanks.

35705,"Almost jumped in front of a car after trying to get help today.The title says it all. In my state a parent is required to be present in order for behavioral health clinics and facilities to even think about seeing you. My mom doesn't really like helping me with anything, and always ""forgets"", so I took matters into my own hands and went to a CODAC facility with my signed papers and recommendation from the doctor. 


I bring everything to the receptionist and she gives me this concerned look and tells me she's pretty sure I need a parent or guardian present but she'll check. So she goes to the back to talk to someone and I overhear them through the door talking about how unless I was emancipated they can't do anything for me. She the na comes out, tells me everything and asks if there's anything else they could do for me. I ask for a bottle of water, she gives me one, and I walk out holding back tears. I had been trying to set this up for around a month and to just have it all collapse in an instant really killed me a little.


After that I call one of my friends to ask for a ride, as I just missed my bus and the next one didn't come for an hour, so I'm sat there waiting for them to respond for fifteen minutes and when she finally does she says she doesn't have enough gas. So I walk to the bus stop, crying, and some little shit yells at me from across the street to ""kill yourself, pussy!"", so I thought it over, it was a green light and there were a few cars coming. I look at the next one and take a step forward about to close my eyes and just fall into it. But something kicks in and I pull myself back and take a drink of water and make my way to the bus stop.

210812,"Thinking i will be alone for the rest of my god damned life. I need someone to talk to.I‚Äôve been saying that I want to kill myself since senior year in high school. That was 3 years ago. Somehow I‚Äôm still trucking. These past 3 years have been really tough and it‚Äôs not even something significant that has altered my life. It‚Äôs just rejection. I‚Äôve been getting rejected a lot by women these past 3 years. At first it wasn‚Äôt easy letting go of someone who didn‚Äôt like you back, but now with the experience I have gotten over the years, it‚Äôs quite easy to move on to a different girl. I‚Äôve definitely missed some opportunities with women liking me and not realizing it. But now I‚Äôll take any opportunity i can get as long as I‚Äôm attracted to them. Ive come along way being that shy, not confident kid who didn‚Äôt know how to talk to girls. But still it hurts a lot. 

I‚Äôve been left on read, ghosted, more recently I went on a date with a girl and she gave me a fake number afterwards. I don‚Äôt understand what I did to deserve that and I‚Äôm not gonna lie it made me feel like complete shit. To make things worse, i went to a party this past weekend, got introduced to a cute girl. We talked for a bit. Asked to get coffee with her and got her number. The next morning i texted her ‚ÄúHey, it was nice meeting you‚Äù. She left me on read. That was Monday. I‚Äôm was talking to another girl that i met on tinder and have been casually texting this past week. We were supposed to go to a bar tonight but guess what? She cancelled on me. Probably done talking with her as well. Just my luck, same shit different day.

I don‚Äôt know why I feel like I need a woman to feel happy about myself but I certainly feel alone. It‚Äôs not even the sex that I want. I just want someone to cuddle with in bed, talk to, and make laugh. The way Hollywood makes it seems so easy and achievable. But it‚Äôs not. Every romantic scene that I see in TV just makes me feel shitty about myself and makes me think ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt that be me?‚Äù. I‚Äôve tried tinder ever since it came out. I‚Äôve maybe had a handful of successful dates? Maybe 3 or 4 first dates that went onto a second date? There was this one specific women that I connected with and I think she felt the same way. Too bad she moved across country, probably most likely won‚Äôt ever see her again. I felt the most compatible with her. But that‚Äôs just my luck I guess. I haven‚Äôt had anything that felt like that since and that was in August. 

I know I should feel more appreciative because I know there‚Äôs a thousand guys out there that wish they could be in my position. But sometimes I wish i was in their position because honestly it doesn‚Äôt feel any better maybe even worse. I‚Äôd like to think that I‚Äôm attractive, I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm handsome. But I don‚Äôt see it yet. I‚Äôm social, funny, approachable...i don‚Äôt get what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I go out, I‚Äôm trying to go out to more bars or just wherever to meet women. I have had so many failures in the dating game that i just feel hideous. I do have a crooked nose and i feel like that‚Äôs a big issue. I‚Äôve gotten plastic surgery to fix it because people were making fun of me for in back in high school but it‚Äôs still slightly fucked up. Who knows, maybe it‚Äôs not as a big deal as I‚Äôm bringing it out to be. Maybe my standards are too high but I‚Äôve always been told to never sell yourself short and always go for the best. And I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna change. I may have fucked up early with being clingy as fuck to some women but I have learned from my mistakes and rejections. I‚Äôm always learning new things about the dating game but nothing seems to change. Same results.

This year I have definitely gone out with more women than in previous years thanks to online apps. But nothing happens after the first date. I think I‚Äôm close to giving up. I dropped out of a huge university back in 2015 because I said some suicidal shit, mainly about my women problems. I‚Äôve been at community college ever since and am transferring to my cities university in the spring that‚Äôs about the same size as my old university. The girl to guy ratio is like 60:40 but I still don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll find anyone. People see me as this confident, funny guy on the outside , but they don‚Äôt know how empty I feel on the inside. Talking to people won‚Äôt help as i already feel like my depression has consumed me and now I‚Äôm just waiting for the right time to kill myself. I‚Äôve been exercising and focusing on school to see if it help me overcome this phase that I‚Äôm going through but I just find myself back to square one. I always expect the worst when a girl takes forever to reply back. I always think maybe I should have said something different. I always think that it‚Äôs something that I did wrong. I always over analyze things. 

I feel as if none of my friends care about me either. Whenever i to hang out with someone, ask for advice, or just want to talk i get left on read. I feel like i have no one. I thought maybe a change of scenery would help me but I‚Äôm starting to think that it‚Äôs gonna make it worse. My goal is to move to Pittsburgh once I get my degree here in NC. Working for the major league team over there, the Pirates would be my dream job as I‚Äôm a huge baseball fan. But now, Im starting to think that it might not happen. I still live with my parents. I did terrible this semester in school, only got one A, I‚Äôm pretty sure i failed or got a D in my other two classes. Will probably be put on academic probation going into next semester.

I don‚Äôt know what keeps me going. All i do now in my free time is drive around and listen to music that i enjoy in my car thinking about different things. What my life could have been if i didn‚Äôt drop out my first university. Why i cant get a girlfriend. Why I‚Äôm such a fuck up. I do this every single damn day. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs therapeutic but it‚Äôs somewhat calming. Im such a fucking moron. I miss everything about my old university it but know that I will never ever go back to study there. I only go back up there to visit friends once a month or so because it is 6 hours away. I feel like they are the only friends I have left.

I just wish a loaded gun would drop right infront of me so I can just end it. I‚Äôve looked online for guns and they‚Äôre expensive, looks like I‚Äôll have to save up but I‚Äôm pretty bad at that too. I‚Äôve started to look at the suicide success rate for guns and I‚Äôm guessing if I find the right gun, it‚Äôs doable. Either it‚Äôs that or I‚Äôll just drive myself to my death but I know I‚Äôll never have the courage to do that. Probably no one is gonna read all of this. Probably nobody cares but I feel like nothings gonna change. I‚Äôm starting to get that feeling about not giving a shit about anymore. I guess next semester will determine what i will do with my life. Hopefully I get rejected a bunch of times so i can get closer to killing myself. I know I‚Äôm gonna keep trying because i have nothing to lose. Hopefully there‚Äôs gonna be a rejection that I will experience that will finally push me off the edge. ",suicide

I'm eighteen years old and I'm absolutely miserable and depressed with how my life has turned out. My parents divorced at a young age and I hardly see my dad anymore, even know I think he's the most badass person in the world. I would do anything to be more like him. I've been bullied since elementary school. I've been called named and beat up pretty much every day for as long as I can remember. I've always been overweight growing up, and it did nothing for me except cause me pain. I had a way shorter temper back then, so I must of been a very easy target. I've had my front teeth knocked out by a kick to the face in middle school, luckily they weren't my adult teeth but it did fuck up those teeth as they started to grow outward. Starting in about 6th or 7th grade, I started getting really sad about everything. I just didn't feel like doing anything since it didn't really seem worth it. 


Around that time is when I started picking out my own clothes to wear, and I grew my hair out longer than it used to be. I picked a lot of blacks and browns to wear to school, and I started wearing black jeans. I wouldn't classify myself as emo, but it was around that at the time. I was just perpetually sad every day. Around the laft half of middle school (7th-8th), I met a girl in an online game that I had been playing at the time. We started talking every day and she was the same was as me, and we just hit it off. During this time, I can honestly say that I was happier than I've ever been since my depression set in. Of course after about a year, she decided it would be best if we broke up. This came out of the blue and it destroyed me. That was the first time I had ever thought about actually killing myself, I tried jumping out my second story window. I would hope to land on my head or maybe my legs so it would cripple me. I ended up not doing this. I found out she started dating someone way older than her, and experienced her first kiss with him after she had promised to wait it out for me. I must be really selfish.

Fast forward to high school. Freshman year. I started to feel a little bit better after getting over that girl and I had actually started to make friends. Thinking about it now, I still can't believe I had actually made friends. I'm such a huge passive jackass, I just can't believe it. I actually ended up meeting another girl online, except this one didn't last as long but it seemed to have way more damaging affects on me. I was staying at my grandmothers lake house during the time she decided to just stop all communication with me all together, no message, nothing. I thought about drowning myself in the lake during the night. 

After this I've tried hanging myself with a belt a few times, and just constantly thinking about doing it overand over again.

Around this time is when I start cutting myself, 10-11th grade. I start cutting on my hands, arms, and neck. I would constantly steal my moms shaving razors and rip the blades out of them. My fingertips would be all kids of fucked up by the time I would get them out. I just loved watching the blood drip from the cuts, and it would taste like metal. I didn't wanna wipe it on a towel or some tissues because I didn't want anyone finding them. I would sometimes let it dry so I could just pick the blood flakes off. I kept this up for a while. My music tastes changed to more hardcore metal and screaming because it turned everyone around me off. I just hated talking to anyone at school. I would sit alone in classes, or at lunch and just keep to myself. The bullying was a lot less frequent, but I just couldn't find myself talking to anyone.


During this time I've stayed in the same school all my life, so I switched out to a new school for a new experience. That lasted about one semester before I was back at my old school and still depressed as ever. 


Skip ahead to now. I'm in a semi-relationship with this girl I really like, except of course she has to be so far away. We always talk about seeing each-other and such, and I can't wait to see that day when it comes. I promised her I wouldn't cut myself anymore when we got together over a year ago, and I haven't. My arms have healed and they're as smooth as ever. But lately things between us have just gotten so rocky for some reason and it does nothing but depress me.  It's not really her, it's probably me. I just hate thinking about her going out, with her living in a big city, I'm worried something might happen. I've tried breaking up with her numerous times, but I just can't do it, I'm in love with her too much.


I've dropped out of school. My dad doesn't know that I have, I just don't have the heart to tell him that his only son is a failure. My divorced mother and father have both had separate children of their own. They had kids at the same time when I was 16. I've been an only child all my life and now it's completely ruined everything. My mom and I move houses every 10months - 1 year. We're currently living with my aunt because we can't afford to live in a real house. Mixed with me dropping out of school, I've been living in a 20ftx20ft room for the past two months. I've lost all my friends, the ones I had anyway. I have no life, no social life. No home. I spent all day either sleeping in my bed or sitting on a chair browsing reddit and talking to this girl. She's really the only social contact I get other than the begging my mother for lunch. I just don't want to upset my girl(friend?) by telling her all this, I don't wanna sound like such a fucking loser. I also just spend my time listening to new music I find (Chillwave, Witch House, Ambient). I've stopped listening to hardcore bullshit, I hated the scene.


Sorry for typing that all out and skipping around a lot. I just feel lost and alone. I just feel like crying now that I think about it. I just want some friends. I'm sure there's more to this story, but I really don't feel like typing anymore of my bullshit life on the internet.


Fuck.

I've thought about my future a lot and the most common outcomes I can see is that I will be either in Jail, Homeless, a Junkie or dead, regardless of what career or dream (that I currently have) pursue, and death seems to be the most appealing option to me. I have kept people from killing themselve by talking to them and making them realize its not worth it, people that I cared about and they slowly just forgot me as a friend, because i'm probably a really hard person to keep as a friend.

I have a friend who moved to Missouri a few months ago. I haven't seen her in months, and she came up for Christmas this week to see her family and then our group of friends. We had made a plan to have some epic 4-day sleepover, hopping from house to house.

I'm never really invited to many sleepovers, so having 4 in a row was a dream. I immediately told my parents all excited and everything, and they were okay with it.

On Wednesday of Christmas week, we were supposed to start the whole ordeal. Today it's Friday, and nothing has happened. I look like a fool infront of my parents now, and I want to just fall to a heap and cry when they ask me why I haven't gone out yet like I said I would.

I text my friend asking what's going on, was I not invited? ( There are some people in our group of friends that really dislike me, so I've gotten used to not being invited to things because of this. ) and she replies back ""Me and Natalia wanted to hang out with her alone"". I just text back ... because nobody had seen her in months and I thought it was a bit selfish to keep her from all of us. She replies, ""Bri says your not even her friend."" to this I text back ""oh, alright then. just tell her i said hi and bye i guess"" and being the believable and compulsive liar i am, the girl believes me and the conversation ends.

I realize now that none of my friends are actually my friends. If I did not sit at the lunch table they all do, or talked to them daily, their lives would not be changed if I did not exist. 

I'm never first to be invited, I'm never texted, I'm never thought of during situations. I realize that my entire social life has been a lie. I got a new phone for christmas, but I never get any texts. I've been sobbing for the past few hours over this. I haven't harmed myself but I'm getting close again and I don't know what to do.

I don't believe in an afterlife and this is the only game in town Et. Al. However I honestly feel like Im facing some pretty adverse life-circumstances that aern't going to be easily reversed this late in the game(almost 30). I had a childhood disease at a very young aged that is known to impact physical coordination, memory, and cognition. I was tossed into the school system after barely surviving as if nothing ever happen, with no follow ups or treatment of any kind. I didn't go to the doctor, or even the dentist for that matter after a very young age. I had academic difficultly as long as I can remember. Speech classes, slow classes, schools and programs for at risk/troubled kids. My parents pretty much let the schools do what ever they wanted with me. They were basically negligent uneducated white trash. I was in cub scouts but never once spoke to the other boys. Other parents would ask if anything was wrong with me, and the response was always ""nothing, he's just quiet. That's just how he is."" Teachers &amp; counselors were always asking me what the problem was and I would say ""I don't know"" with tears in my eyes. I never felt normal. I felt people didn't like me, that they blamed me for everything, and were constantly annoyed by me. This was all before shit really hit the fan with my parents violent divorce. Then I really just broke. All attempts at hygiene went out the window &amp; no one bothered to correct the behavior, preferring to just let me do my thing, which consisted solely of playing single player video games, and watching television. I hated the world and everyone in it. Didn't want to play with other kids, flirt with girls, or peruse any real hobbies. Horrible acne, broken glasses for months at a time. My teeth were always a problem but it was never taken care of. I've only recently discovered that a rich uncle offered to pay for my dental work but my parents refused. Started fighting all the time in middle school, basically had no friends at all for a whole decade. Fought tooth &amp; nail to drop out of high school because I just couldn't stand it any more. Had a rough time integrating in to the work force I had a hard time keeping jobs for a long time, and still do to a lesser extent on the verge of possibly losing another (job with no positive work history). Didn't start dating until I was in my 20's (still haven't had a girlfriend, &amp; never been on a second date). I did eventually get my GED, and somehow scored in the 90 percentile on the test, but when I tried going to community college I botched my financial aid, and couldn't afford to by books. I dropped all my classes but botched that too, and now owe a bunch of money. I'm at the point where I have to accept that trial &amp; error just isn't going to produce different results, and I'm never going to ""find my Niche"" in society, and I probably do need to be on drugs, if I'm going to ever have any chance of functioning in society on any acceptable level. I've sought help in multiple counties, and I've come to the conclusion that public mental heath is basically completely useless. Now that I have tax money coming in I have an appointment with a private psych whom I've heard good things about, and I'm looking to academia trying to contact various nearby universities. If these options don't pan out I just don't know. I cant think pass this any more if medical science cant help I guess I'm really am just junk. I cant believe this is what it has come to.

* My father had an affair that led to a baby. Family is crumpling apart, but fortunately my mother wants to stay. Lots of fighting persists and I have to essentially care for my little brother during these moments

* I got in a nasty car crash. My mother opted to take the blame, I was too shocked to say no. I kept complaining about cameras. I got charged with obstruction but luckily kept my permit license after traffic school. I am deathly afraid of driving. I cant look whenever we make a left turn, and this has hurt my accessibility.

*  I've been a straight A student with amazing Standardized test scores. After all of the top affordable universities rejected me, I got stuck with going to a state school. I have no one to live with, nor have nor idea how to live on my own since my learning skills have been hindered by the family crippling.

* Now that I realized by antisocial harcore studying has done nothing, I realized I fucked up. I should have made friends rather than memorize test answers. I should have  joined a club or have a hobby rather than neatly finish math homework. So many ""I should have done this or thats."" It is killing me.

* I have 0 friends. I have never been active or social, but usually I have people I can talk to in the hallways at high school. Since the recent events, I have shelled up. I spend my time at the library doing crap on their computers. I get especially anxious whenever they close the library because then I have to wander the hallways.

* All this piled up and now my class is requiring meet ups or socials. I cant handle that. I just want to ball up and binge watch Top Gear because that is the only thing that is taking my mind off of suicide.


That's basically the jist. My parents cant afford therapy. After all the court sessions and alimony, my father lost his job and corresponding disability leave (He is diabetic). So now we are living off less than we had. I have an older brother who basically quit on caring for us after all that happened. My younger is energetic and I love him nlike no one ever before, though Sometimes I get so angry at him that I strike him. Yet, every day I cry thinking of how terrible life must be for him.

I'm not asking for help. I just want to know if it will be okay. If someone has pulled past something similiar. How can I do something about this. What can **I** do? All I can think about is where I can hang myself, or if enough cough syrup can kill me.",suicide

I just wanna share my story. It all started 2 years ago, where I ducks up my relationship with the girl I was sure I was gonna end up marrying, she was the girl I had been looking for! After we broke up, I started being inside a lot, like 24 hours every single day of the week. ( I used to play soccer 4 times a week, but quit that too) Stopped attending school, cause why would I bother to show up. I got kicked out of school, and started to be a lot on the computer, started gaming, and that‚Äôs basically all I do now, I‚Äôve gained a lot of weight, until I started to starve myself, and in 3 months, I‚Äôve lost 34,8kg. And I now weigh 58kg as a 17 year old guy. 
I‚Äôve tried to kill myself multiple times, and failed every time. But this time it‚Äôs totally different, I actually wanna die, for real. I hate being here, I feel like a burden to everyone, and especially my family, which I moved away from, cause I felt I put them in a bad light. My arms are covered an scars from cuts and self harm, and I hate being with other people.

I am stuck living in an incredibly homophobic place. I can't talk to anyone about my sexuality, and the only person that I told is a counselor, who suggested that I best keep it to myself. It's so suffocating to bear, but the alternative is getting beaten up, disowned, and being homeless.

I had the chance to spend two days with a guy and... it was the best two days of life. Not much happened aside from kissing, but for me that was everything.

But he was just here visiting and I won't see him again, unless I can by some miracle move closer to him, and there is very low chance of that happening. I developed feelings and now I'm just :(

My head is really messed up. I had the best two days ever, and I can't even talk to anyone about it without risking things. 

I can't bring myself to eat or sleep, and I am can't focus on anything but the fact that I am alone again and stuck in this hellhole. 

I wish I had more time with him. I wish I wasn't stuck here. I wish I had hope that I can ever have a happy relationship. I wish that I could see him again.

347524,"Suicidal, Begging For Help and Turned Away - Retaliation From A Crisis Center Because I Turned In My Sexually Deviant TherapistI went to the hospital in the back of a police car yesterday against my will.  This was a first for me. 

I have a lot of trauma I haven't dealt with yet and every once in awhile it percolates up and this morning it happened.  After crying on the bathroom floor for a few minutes my mom came in and asked if I was OK.  I was too upset to respond so she just walked away and left me on the floor.  She came back after awhile but I still couldn't talk.  Shame overwhelmed me and all I could think about were suicide scenarios to finally end the suffocating pain that wells up inside me like a tsunami.

After about 40 minutes of crying on the floor I realized I had been away from my daughter for awhile and needed to get back to her.
When I stood up I could see myself in the mirror and felt disgusted.  I slapped my face repeatedly and as hard as I could, punishing myself for being the horrible human that at the time I thought I was.  I grabbed my laundry to go home and I almost made it out of the cabin before mom stopped me.  I told her the memories I was having from my childhood and she denied everything, invalidating everything I felt.  I started to really lose it, my voice screaming as loud as it could at her that I wanted to die.  That's when her husband came tearing out of the back room with a finger pointed at me so I ran away.



I ended up under a tree on the property.  It took me about 15 minutes to run through my DBT skills. I still felt sad because DBT does not take away emotion, it simply provides a means to regulate emotions.  I went to the fifth wheel and was just starting a movie when I saw a sheriff car pull into the driveway.



I went outside and was surrounded by four sheriffs.  I have had many interactions with this department prior to DBT but this was different.  I explained that I had been upset and ran away but did my skills and was much better, no longer suicidal at all.  They didn't believe me and forced me to go to the hospital.  The sheriff that drove me to the hospital was cold and short and wouldn't explain to me what law he was enforcing or why I had to go to the hospital.  Luckily I have skills and was able to not react to his hostility and just went with the situation so I could get back home to my daughter as soon as possible.  I saw the doctor briefly, explained myself and was promptly released.



The next day I called the Sheriffs to find out why this interaction was so different.  Turns out I had told my mom ""give me a gun, I want to shoot myself"" which she relayed to 911.  According to the sheriff deputy I talked to all they heard was 'gun' and that's why there were four of them and they were so serious.



It was during this call I learned the most horrifying fact and it has blown my mind.  A couple years ago I was seeing a male therapist that was going through a divorce.  He ended up telling me he thought about me when he pleasured himself, as well as many other disgusting comments.  I reported him to his facility but wasn't taken seriously.  After he told me about pleasuring himself I reported him to the neighboring county's facility, where I had been a patient years earlier.  I eventually sued the county facility that employed him and was quieted with a 50k settlement, of which I got 24 after the lawyer and fees.  I wish I had taken it to trial but my lawyer basically said no.



A year after the lawsuit I was doing really bad.  I was in the emergency room three times in two weeks for suicide ideation.  The hospital set me up an appointment at the neighboring county's mental health facility, where I had been a patient years earlier and the same facility that I had reported my sick therapist.



I was barely hanging on, waiting desperately for my appointment.  An hour before the appointment I got a horrible phone call.  It was the facility cancelling my appointment.  They said that my medicaid wouldn't cover it because I don't live in their county.  I attempted to explain that I did live in their county, my mailing address is in the other county.  I also tried to explain that medicaid has different benefits in different counties and I knew my medicaid was in the right county because my medical doctor only takes the same county's medicaid.  It's confusing but basically they were lying and I knew it.  The person who called ignored me and just kept repeating that her director would not allow me to be seen.  This is the same exact director to whom I had reported the sexually-inappropriate therapist.



I hung up, cried and cried and started to picture my suicide in graphic detail.  Terrified and alone, I called the facility back and asked to speak with the director. I tried to explain to her but I was so upset and had been so desperate for help I was furious that they were denying me their services.  I begged and told her I was on the verge of suicide with a specific method and hung up because I was so upset.  I called a final time on my way to commit suicide.  I called to thank them for pushing me to finally go through with it.  I told them where I was and my plan and then hung up.



When I got to my planned location I realized there was a complication and I wanted to be sure this wouldn't be another attempt.  I was working on the complication when a sheriff stopped.  I asked him what county this was and he reassured me it was the county I thought it was.  He was disappointed to hear what happened and offered me a ride to the hospital which I happily accepted.  All I wanted was help.



I stayed in the hospital for 12 days while a psychiatrist adjusted my meds,  The only access to a psychiatrist while on medicaid in Washington is through inpatient psychiatric hospitalization.  There is not a single psychiatrist in Washington that accepts medicaid.  My only option had been my medical doctor and it wasn't working.  Not at all.



When I got out of the hospital I was curious about the facility refusing to see me while in crisis and had a sneaking suspicion it had something to do with my lawsuit against the neighboring facility.  I called and stated that I had a friend in crisis that didn't live in the county but was suicidal and they didn't hesitate.  They immediately said to bring her in, it didn't matter what insurance or where she lived if she was in crisis.



Since that phone call I filed a grievance with the ombudsman.  I described that I thought I was being retaliated against and I wanted to make sure that never happens again.  I got a letter saying they got my grievance and I tried to let it go.



Until my phone call with the Sheriff recently.  You see the sheriff couldn't find a 911 call on the day I was rescued.  There is no report or call at all for me that day.  THEY NEVER CALLED 911.  That sheriff just happened to be driving by, which explains why he didn't have lights on.



Let me reiterate that: the mental health facility that is also the acting crisis line not only cancelled my appointment and refused to see me for a completely false reason (they lied, I've checked with medicaid- they lied about that and it didn't matter anyway, I was in crisis) they DID NOT CALL 911 after three phone calls begging for help and telling them my plan. They've called them in the past when I stormed out of the office but after being the victim of a sick therapist and reporting him, they not only refused to see me but would have been the last people to speak to me before a very successful suicide.  Isn't a crisis line obligated to call 911 if a caller is in imminent danger?



On top of all that, later that same day my mom called the facility to find out what happened.  She had been at the emergency room with me and knew I had that appointment.  They not only broke the HIPPA laws and spoke to her about me but they told her I cancelled my appointment.  That's right, they lied and told my mom that I had called that morning and cancelled my appointment.



This is the county-funded mental health facility that cancelled my appointment an hour before it was supposed to happen, claiming it was because of medicaid. They refused to see me and sent me into crisis and did NOT CALL 911 when I was seconds from death.  The only reason I am ALIVE right now is a sheriff happened to be driving by.  Then they lied AGAIN and told my mom I  cancelled my appointment.  An appointment made by the Designated Mental Health Professional in the emergency room and the condition of my release from the hospital.



A couple years before I reported the bad therapist I had been a patient at this facility with the same medicaid and never had an issue.  This is retaliation for reporting and subsequently suing for justice.  He was not fired until I sued, months after I reported him.",suicide

For well over half an hour I was just staring at the sky thinking that I should think about something to change my situation but all I could think about was that I should think. After some time I decided that I'm in a good enough shape that I can go back to the restaurant and so I did. When I got to the restaurant I just sat in my chair and with my head in my hands waited for the party to be over.

I'm going to graduate next month and for me it's like meh. Everyone has a job except me, I look for them but there's nothing for me, just stuff not related to my field.

No one knows how I feel except my (ex) girlfriend, that just left me because she doesn't want to deal with someone like me, she always said she would help me but she never did, she barely wanted to see me because she was tired because of her job (but she had time to do other stuff or see friends but no me).

I feel like garbage, completely useless, I'm not happy with me, how I look, how I am. I try to see something interesting on me but I can't do anything, I know anything, no skills.

I'm really tired of everything around me, people, situations I have no desire to live, I feel like I'm just here in this world with no purpose, I'm just floating around. Everything would be fine if I were dead, I forget about this shit around me. At the end of the day I have no friends, no one really cares about me, no one talk to me, I'm always the weirdo, that I don't speak, shy, but they don't know how I feel, everything inside of me and I hate that fact, because I have tried before to be different but people still see me as always and I'm tired of it.

The only thing that really help a little bit but really, a little bit, are my parents because they have given me everything I have. But it's not enough, simply I don't want to live, I hate me and I hate everyone and their happy lives and their jobs. They are just perfect. And I'm just here, playing video games, reading, or running just to forget but it doesn't help at all. I have low self-esteem, I'm insecure.

I need to be better, but I‚Äôm a shit human being. I disappoint and I let down and I flake. I just feel like the world would be better off without me, you know? 

Anyway. I wrote an rant about autobiographies earlier which isn‚Äôt even close to having cohesive ideas. But I just want to say it. I know it‚Äôs repetitive and meandering and too abstract to be understood by anyone with any sense, but I want to shout these feelings into the void. I‚Äôm sorry you had to end up in the same one as I. 

on autobiographies‚Äî fuck you for thinking you matter
it is incomprehensibly arrogant to think that anyone would care about your life:
a stranger, just another of billions of billions of lives that exist ephemerally on this earth every day

‚Äî !
How dare you think that anyone cares about you and what you‚Äôve done?
Nothing you have ever done has had any meaning to anyone other than those whom you‚Äôve directly affected. Nor will it ever. 

The measure of an impactful life begins and ends with the connections one has made. Nothing more, and nothing less. No one cares about your life. Your thoughts, your words, your experiences. They are meaningless, and for you to think for a SECOND that they matter is mind-bogglingly self-centered. 

I hate biographies, but my most fervent vitriol I reserve for autobiographies. Anyone can write a book and pretend that those people who read about their brief, insignificant stints admire them, or value them, or even consider them as anything but a distorted mirror through which they see themselves. And to pretend that your life matters is the worst arrogance of them all. When people read about you, they don‚Äôt care about you. They don‚Äôt care about how you‚Äôve felt, or what you‚Äôve thought, or what you‚Äôve done. They only see you as a vessel through which they might encounter some spark that will give meaning to their worthless lives. I do not mean for worthless to be an offensive accusation. Rather, I state it as a fact. Every life is just as worthless as every other. 

I read about your life story, and all I see are the ways in which you are similar to me. and I wonder if you have some value that I do not. For look at you‚Äî look at all you‚Äôve done. And look at what I‚Äôve done. It‚Äôs folly, I know. Neither of us matters. but there is a dark, aching sting in knowing that I matter even less. IS every life just as worthless as any other? The truth sits like a cold stone on the floor of my chest. I know that‚Äôs not true. I am more worthless. I don‚Äôt deserve to be here. 

And then I see the ways in which we are different. I see in you a mirror, and you reflect back at me everything I hate about myself. You highlight every shortcoming, every flaw. Every idea you articulate is a reminder that I have never had an original thought. 

I hate that anyone can ever feel as though their lives are worth something. Because I can‚Äôt. 



I know. I know that all we can ever do is write about ourselves. I am incapable of knowing anything else, and I don‚Äôt even have a firm grasp on that‚Äî who I am, I mean. I wish I were gone from this earth so I wouldn‚Äôt have to bear the burden of knowing how many resources I waste in my existence. I don‚Äôt deserve to be here. None of us do.

Feeling a bit angry, I attempted suicide and I have chronic pain now. Been dealing with my injuries for over a year now. Made another two suicide attempts which just worsened the pain.


Don't want to get into the details of the suicide attempt but as far as stressors and personal issues go I'm trans and I'm fucking ugly as hell so I'm always alone dealing with a lot of invalidation, unemployment, I have a bad work ethic, I was dismissed from my university. I feel fucking worthless.


  live in an authoritarian household, my parents are Mormon while I'm atheist. Rather than a relationship with my mom and a relationship with my dad they treat it as if when I talk to one I'm talking to both..


They're disappointed in me, have told me to my face. My parents left me for homeless for a week and a half after my roommates wrote a letter to get me evicted for cooking pot. I have a patch of scars on my right arm from sleeping on concrete. They took my cookware to show the landlord, prior to that they vandalized my property, not sure why but I wouldn't put it past my gender.


My parents insist on using my assigned-at-birth pronouns and name rather than my preferred, I now live under their roof.


I realized another suicide attempt like my past 3 would just leave me in more pain and if I think about suicide I'm just wasting time respirating so now I'm planning something much more long term and serious, have my heart set on a method with very high lethality, it's just a matter of access to transportation and as I improve my life, i.e. getting a job, access to transportation, this method becomes accessible for me..

Hey, I am an 18 year old *Lebanese* gamer. The reason Im writing this is to show you a bit of my gaming experience as a gamer in Lebanon

Disregarding the super slow internet, we get power outages every 4-6 hours, which means you get disconnected from any match you're playing. So when I decide to play at 1 PM after studying, Im probably gonna be in a match when the clock strikes 2 and the power goes out, erasing all memories of the shitty randoms and the 9 kills I got this game.

But it doesnt end there! Imagine yourself currently at the heat of the battle and are so close to down the whole squad single handedly while your random teammates spam the ""revive me"" button, then the power goes out because its now 6 PM.

OR playing Ranked matches! Other than the unstable ping and packet loss like a woman on her period, imagine being so concentrated on the screen of your TV/monitor, calculating every move of the enemy team and doing complex probability... when suddenly the clock strikes 12 AM and its time for your hourly dose of power outage. 

You stand still in pitch black darkness, in eerie silence. As you hear your father snore from the other room, you slowly comprehend that all you've done is lost, and youre probably gonna get a penalty for abandoning the match.

""But I play singleplayer offline games"" you might say...well you didnt save for the past 20 minutes and autosave didnt manage as well. You cant log back in and resume because the save file is now corrupt and you have to repeat the last 2 hours of the game

Its a bit sad and funny at the same time, but since we survived a fucking port explosion and years of corruption, we can manage the ping

176611,"Friend tried to OD on pills today. Not sure what to do.I apologize if I leave out any details. There's a LOT of things that have happened and I just don't have the willpower to type in everything. If you need clarification, ask, and I'll edit my OP to give detail.

A friend of mine tried to kill herself today. What led her to decide to try to take her own life are the following:

* For several months, she hung out with a group that peer pressured her to take dangerous diet pills in order to lose weight. She has serious body image issues
* Said group stalked her after work and coerced her to take some pills which led her to black out. She woke up in the ER room.
* Someone broke into her grandparents' house (she and her mom and brother lives with her grandparents) and stole the car along with some other belongings. Her mom tried to blame her first and the cops interrogated her. Turns out (surprise) that she didn't steal the car
* She's struggling in school. She works full-time as well to support herself and she's failing one class.
* She and her mother got in a huge fight in which her mother said some very caustic words after discovering a pack of razors in her room.

More details on her mother: I have only what my friend said, but her mother (and the rest of her family) aren't very supportive at all. They're strict, religious people, and don't like the fact that she doesn't share the same religious beliefs as they do. When she told her mother about the drugs/blackout incident, she got mad and was mad the entire time she took her to the hospital to get a rape kit done. According to her, her own brother said that he wish he didn't have her as a sister.

Before she tried to take her own life, she called a local suicide prevention hotline. She said that the guy who answered the call wasn't very understanding so she hung up and gave up. 

Any advice would be appreciated. She tried going to the school mental health office, and didn't like the lead counselor. She said the counselor was way too touchy-feely and made her uncomfortable. 

I feel like this has become a dead end. The school counselor wasn't helpful. The suicide intervention counselor wasn't helpful. Her own fucking parent's blame the victim. I'm so tempted to just call her mom and tell her to buck the fuck up and be there for her daughter.

Suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I fear that she's going to try this again. I suggested that she drop out of her math class to reduce the stress.",suicide

- Wearing a mask and social distancing is a small price to pay for things to go back to normal -

Until a couple of weeks ago, I was an anti-masker. I live in Florida, and work in a restaurant; and it was only until masks became mandatory in my restaurant, after months of not wearing one, that I came around and understood the importance of wearing a mask. My excuses were that it is hot. I am constantly running around and wearing a mask, I thought, would slow me down and make me uncomfortable. The funny thing is, I‚Äôd never actually worn a mask before so I had no real knowledge of what wearing it would feel like. Let me tell you all, ITS NOT THAT BAD. Sure you might get a LITTLE warmer than you would if you weren‚Äôt wearing it, but that is a reasonable price to pay for preserving the safety and lives of others. I have taken a complete 180 on this issue and feel guilty for my stance before. Let me be clear. A mask does not make you immune to coronavirus. I work in an overcrowded restaurant, and even after wearing a mask every second at work, i still tested positive for coronavirus a few days ago. Social interaction is the worst possible thing we could be doing right now and I am quarantined in my house with a lot of things to think about. How my comfort used to overrule others‚Äô safety. How I used to hate people pushing for masks, how annoying it was, and now how important it is. If anyone reading this would just take a minute to examine what makes their life more important than anyone else‚Äôs, I think we would have a lot more lives saved. A mask doesn‚Äôt make you immune, but it does help. And refusing to wear one, going out partying, and not social distancing is a selfish and deadly exercise to partake in. I wish you all well and urge you to please wear masks as often as you can, and only go outside for things that are truly necessary. The lives and wellbeing of those around you, and yourself, are more important than your body temperature.",non-suicide

It's fucked up. I'm fucked up. I broke down in my bedroom as soon as the clock struck midnight when I realized that I was ""celebrating"" my birthday in isolation.

179698,"AvalancheWhen you have depression it‚Äôs like it snows every day. Some days it‚Äôs only a couple of inches. It‚Äôs a pain in the ass, but you still make it to work, the grocery store. Sure, maybe you skip the gym or your friend‚Äôs birthday party, but it IS still snowing and who knows how bad it might get tonight. Probably better to just head home. Your friend notices, but probably just thinks you are flaky now, or kind of an asshole. 

Some days it snows a foot. You spend an hour shovelling out your driveway and are late to work. Your back and hands hurt from shovelling. You leave early because it‚Äôs really coming down out there. Your boss notices.

Some days it snows four feet. You shovel all morning but your street never gets ploughed. You are not making it to work, or anywhere else for that matter. You are so sore and tired you just get back in the bed. By the time you wake up, all your shovelling has filled back in with snow. Looks like your phone rang; people are wondering where you are.
You don‚Äôt feel like calling them back, too tired from all the shovelling. Plus they don‚Äôt get this much snow at their house so they don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre still stuck at home. They just think you‚Äôre lazy or weak, although they rarely come out and say it.

Some weeks it‚Äôs a full-blown blizzard. When you open your door, it‚Äôs to a wall of snow. The power flickers, then goes out. It‚Äôs too cold to sit in the living room anymore, so you get back into bed with all your clothes on. The stove and microwave won‚Äôt work so you eat a cold Pop Tart and call that dinner. You haven‚Äôt taken a shower in three days, but how could you at this point? You‚Äôre too cold to do anything except sleep.

Sometimes people get snowed in for the winter. The cold seeps in. No communication in or out. The food runs out. What can you even do, tunnel out of a forty foot snow bank with your hands? How far away is help? Can you even get there in a blizzard? If you do, can they even help you at this point? Maybe it‚Äôs death to stay here, but it‚Äôs death to go out there too.

The thing is, when it snows all the time, you get worn all the way down. You get tired of being cold. You get tired of hurting all the time from shovelling, but if you don‚Äôt shovel on the light days, it builds up to something unmanageable on the heavy days. You resent the hell out of the snow, but it doesn‚Äôt care, it‚Äôs just a blind chemistry, an act of nature. It carries on regardless, unconcerned and unaware if it buries you or the whole world.

Also, the snow builds up in other areas, places you can‚Äôt shovel, sometimes places you can‚Äôt even see. Maybe it‚Äôs on the roof. Maybe it‚Äôs on the mountain behind the house. Sometimes, there‚Äôs an avalanche that blows the house right off its foundation and takes you with it. A veritable Act of God, nothing can be done.

I don't know if it's going to get better, ya know? Life has not been so kind and I have no idea how people do basic things. But if I'm going to die, why not just take some risks?

I know exercise helps. I know friends help. Getting out of oneself. I know drinking does not help. I didn't have any alcohol today, so I might be in a little withdrawal. So effin lonely, but not feeling like I'm going to die soon is something. 

I fucking hate resolutions, but one thing is that I just want to keep trying and not let people get me down. Andrew Solomon called depression ""a disease of loneliness,"" so unfortunately I'm going to have to leave my cave at some point and face them: judgmental, duplicitous, manipulative, shallow, materialistic humans. I will have to tease a few people who aren't total shits out of this morass. 

I do know that self-esteem is key. I'll have to start small. Just staying sober and exercising will probably be a good start. 

I hope I can read my journal from the past few weeks and feel empathy for that person and not want to kill her. Just know that she's been through the ringer and deserves better care. ",suicide

300603,"Today I imagined how I will commit a suicide on New Year nightMy life may look perfect to you. I'm 30 years old, working in tech industry in top tier company with good salary, recently was promoted. I know that I can find new better job in a day if I want to. Recently I bought an expensive condo in downtown and have enough savings to solve not-anticipated financial problems.

I am living in foreign country, all my relatives are thousands miles away. I have only one friend and never had a girlfriend. The loneliness destroyed me mentally from inside over last year.

I'm suffering from a deep depression and derealization, receiving treatment for last 4 months. Was working with 2 different psychiatrists, tried bunch of different medications without any signs of improvement.

I had suicidal thoughts for a while but they seemed to be manageable and did not bother me a lot. It was rather a curiosity.

Couple of weeks ago I told my friend as a joke that if nothing changes in 2 months (by New Year), I‚Äôll have to figure out something, meaning maybe moving to other country (but internally I also thought about suicide).

Tonight I was feeling significantly worse than ever and I figured that I won‚Äôt get better by the NY, and thought about how I will end it. In my imagination I went upstairs to the rooftop, stepped over the rail, thought about what I‚Äôm doing, spread hands like a bird, closed my eyes and stepped forward‚Ä¶ I imagined that a few seconds I‚Äôll be falling down and then everything will end. I reviewed this situation ever and ever again, thought about when I should do it so nobody can see me, what happens if someone will try to stop me‚Ä¶.

It felt so real and scary. I got tachycardia, feeling of lump in my throat, had trouble breathing. I never was so scared in my life and not even because of this experience but because NY is getting closer and closer and I don‚Äôt anticipate any solution to my problem. I don't want to end it like this but I don‚Äôt want it to keep going.

I tried to calm down, went for a walk outside and come back to the office. I tried to get in touch with my friend but he seems to be busy tonight. Its 9PM and I‚Äôm afraid to go home.",suicide

262512,"I‚Äôm so tiredEvery day is a battle. Some days I feel as though they make me stronger. Others I wonder just how much more of this I can withstand. Then there are the days where a part of myself, my own mind, insists I must end it all. Right now. Right this very moment. 

Those days, I spend so much time fighting myself, trying to silence this part of me that wants to make it all stop. It‚Äôs becoming harder and harder to argue against. It‚Äôs been this way for over ten years. I am an adult now. I have fully supported myself for years. Things are actually pretty ok. So why must I fight myself to stay alive?

I am so tired. My lists of reasons to live have been replaced by reasons to not do it today. Minor inconveniences for those in my life, my roommate having to find a subletter for the rest of our lease or my coworkers having to cover for me until they can replace me. That list is quickly followed by all the ways I could prepare them for my departure: emptying my bank account to cover rent for a few months, doing it when I have a few days off in a row and they‚Äôd have some time to figure out the schedule. This list scares me the most. It makes me realize just how ready and willing I am. The right time will present itself soon enough, and I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt be strong enough to fight back.

I know my friends and family would understand. They would grieve me, they would miss me, but they would understand. They know the pain I have endured since I was a young child. They have watched me suffer. They will not say it, but they know I have not gotten any better.

Even if I could get anything in this world that I wanted, I don't think that would help. The only thing that I want is to feel happy, but other than occasional forced happiness caused by drugs there's nothing in this world that manages to trigger this feeling for me anymore. And dying doesn't even sound that bad. I feel bad for my family but I feel like I mostly feel bad because I have to, I don't care how they'd feel after my death too much. This hurts to even type but I see no reason to lie to myself. And the only person in this world I truly care about will probably forget me in a month, maybe a year. Who cares. I can't force them to care about me as much just because they meant everything to me.

273635,"I'm am so fucking tired of living.

Every. Single. Goddamn day I wake up after my 3-5 hours of sleep ready to die! The only solace I get is using my dab pen constantly to forget about the cesspool of emotions that my brain contains. I don't think i've been sober since July 8th, but who the hell remembers! I certainly don't. I only go to half my classes, and I barely feel the motivation to do homework anymore. It's the same routine every day. Wake up. Go to school/work. Come home. Stay awake for endless hours because you think about how many times you've embarrassed yourself in front of people. How many times you've been a burden. How many people you've hurt. I've tried for so long to be happy. I took 90 prescribed sleeping pills 2 years ago to try and end it all.

Sadly, it didn't work. I can't even kill myself right.

I bullshitted my way out of therapy and psychiatry. All I said was ""Yea I'm ok :)"" and they believed it. Only reason I wanted out is because therapy doesn't work for me. Talking about my problems won't make them go away. There's nothing you can say to me that will make my father stop hating me. There's nothing you can say to take back all of the years of abuse. I can't get over it. If i'm not good enough for the man who fucking created me, a deadbeat alcoholic, then whats the point? I don't have enough willpower to kill myself. I'm afraid if I survive another attempt I'll never get out of therapy. 

Work is hell. School is hell. Home is depressing as fuck.

But I should be fine right? I have enough money from my job to pay off community college, I just got a boyfriend who cares about me, and I'm passing all my classes. So what should I even be worrying about?

Good things never last for me. Every boyfriend i've had shows their psycho side eventually. I'm really trying this time with him. I want to trust him. I want to let my guard down. I just can't. I've done that too many times and got my heart broken. I'm done.

I usually only eat one meal a day now. Antidepressants don't help with anything.

Anyways the only reason i'm posting this here is because my friends are tired of hearing about my problems.",suicide

86527,"help...please?For all you TL;DR's out there, I don't think I'm gonna actually commit suicide, if you care.

Here's the deal- my father's dying.  He's been getting sicker for the past 4ish years, and now he's transitioning to hospice.  It could be days, weeks, I don't know.  My mother tries to keep me in the dark (I go to college on the other side of the country), which doesn't help me not worry (sorry for the double negative).  As of yesterday he's pale, confused, has a temp of 95F,  falling often, and refusing to go to the ER.  So I really have no idea how much longer it'll be, or if I should wait till Christmas to go home.

I have so many things I want to ask him, but now it's too late, because of his dementia.  I can't do anything but sit in my bed in cry all day.  It almost just hurts to live.  I want to go out and fuck some stranger, or get drunk at 10am, or shave my head, or cut myself...anything to let other people know how I feel.

Nobody at my college knows what I'm dealing with, except for one person, my BFF and roommate.  He's currently at his new girlfriend's place right now (midnight), and I don't really want to interrupt them (I'm a girl, and wouldn't blame her for resenting me).  The thing is, I don't know how I'm going to get through the next five minutes.  I've had way too much wine and Nyquil, can't sleep, and my roommates will be back soon so I can't even cry without them knowing.  My HS friends are on the East Coast, and we've grown apart, so I really don't have anyone to talk to.

It feels like my mind's in this endless loop, about how much of a failure I am, and how my life won't get better, and how I could just take 2 more Nyquil now, 2 more when I wake up in the morning, and have a full day's oblivion.  I'll see my friend tomorrow afternoon after his classes, and bawl my eyes out then, but I don't know how I'm going to make it till then.  It just seems like things shouldn't have to be this hard...",suicide

94983,"I want out.I was in the middle of writing a massive essay about my life story lmao but it just felt like I was asking for attention. 

I just want to feel normal. Life lacks purpose and thats been really fucking with me lately. I've been severely depressed since year 10 (uk) and always had anxiety issues with both just getting worse and worse. I'm 17, college dropout and cant find a job. I want to die but I don't want to kill myself, I just want it to end, or change but that change just wont happen seeing as it's all caused by some fuck up in the brain. I've went to kill myself many times but I just couldn't jump. I always got too scared lol. Which leaves me feeling like an even bigger failure. I stopped self harming about a year ago but I always look at the scares and urges come back, and recently I've been getting worse again and I'm constantly thinking about burning myself because I'm desperate for some sort of rush. I need to feel alive, I crave constant change in my life and I feel like that's going to end up biting me in the ass. Like I'm probably gonna fuck up so many jobs because I'll get bored or I'll move onto harder drugs just  because I'm bored of the ones I'm doing. 

I just feel like it's all so pointless. Even if I do die at old age I'm just going to get forgotten about in a few years at most so why not end now? I just feel like an empty husk.

I'm scared and I've no clue what to do. She lives in a totally different state than me. She's jobless and out of school. She called herself a NEET. Not Employed, in Education, or in Training. She says she'll have enough money to last 2 weeks. Then she can move in with her SO, however she stated right after she said that, that she would kill herself instead of doing that.

She see's herself as worthless and alone. Rejected by everyone else, even her own parents.

I care about her so fucking much I can't even put it into words. I'm afraid I'll say something wrong. I'm hoping that she'll still be here tomorrow, but I don't have much time left.

Please... I need some help. I don't have any information about her other than a First name, Last initial, and State. I don't even know if she lied to me about any of those. She might have, just to stop me from tracking her.

The only contact I have with her is online through Steam, which is a gaming service. No phone number, email, or anything of the sort.

EDIT: I've talked to a Suicide live chat online, same organization as the guys who answer the hotline, and have things I'm planning to do. Getting her phone number is a #1, and perhaps other ways of contacting her. Though I'm still extremely afraid that I'm walking on a sheet of ice that's no wider than my printer paper.",suicide

I've started succumbing;
My demise is on the rise I can feel it coming

Why do I say my?
as if I have a sense of self;
I've been used up, and instead of in the trash, put back on the shelf

Why does anybody do anything?
Why are we here?
Just to suffer, I must admit there's nothing I hold dear 

We all die but who really lives;
I know it's not me;
The only time I feel alive is when I'm in my dreams 

I wish someone would understand;
And that would be it;
Selfish, sick, self pitying asshole, I guess I'm just full of shit 

Father said I cant kill myself;
""Nobody has that right"";
Suffocating me since my birth is what made me see the light 

Family is just the same;
They nod and agree;
Their closed minds have closed my eyes to what this world could be 

I cling to anyone who sees;
The nature of their lies;
But to live in spite is even worse, I'd still rather die

Oh god;
You know I dont think you're real;
Still there must be someone to blame for the way I've been made to feel 

I guess soon I'll know;
What has been debated for years;
God or not, this life is already a hell crafted by my fears

Eighteen now;
I still can't see past it;

I've reached out to the suicide lifeline. I've tried to chat with people. I don't have almost any friends to reach out to anymore - my OCD leaves me very isolated - but I've been reaching out to them. And while I've found support and kindness...I've found nothing to give me hope.

That's all I want now. Hope that it will get better and that I won't have to be alone.

My grandfather took his own life - and I've seen firsthand what that does. The pain it leaves in its wake. I don't want to do that to anyone, but between feeling like I'm willing myself to keep going for others and finding that I have almost no 'others' in my life to live for...

Last year it took a serious turn for the worst, there were weeks where my mother refused to talk to me and my father only talked to me about my school work. At one point my mother wanted to kick me out for reasons I‚Äôm still unsure. This all led to me developing unhealthy habits, a little self harm but mainly an eating addiction, so you can assume I put on a lot of weight. So in September I started gyming in my uncles garage. I would train everyday for about 3 months, and I was making good progress. But for better or worse my father forced me to stop because I wasn‚Äôt doing what my body needed apparently. In response to this I started eating  a shit ton again. During October me and I girl I knew for about 6 months at that time started dating. It ended with her ghosting me essentially. Our country‚Äôs in another lockdown so it was easy for her. That affected me pretty badly, I still think about her everyday . As you can imagine, all these things add up to me being pretty sad.

I'm 24, at university, graduating next year. About 1,5 years I stumbled on to an online gambling site and decided to give it a go, played 20 euros and won 120. 1,5 years later and I'm dead broke, spent all my savings (2500 euros), got 2000 euros in Paypal debt and just lost my last winnings from yesterday. This is it. There is no more. Paypal won't cover me anymore since they limited my account because of the debt. I don't have any money. I honestly can't believe what has happened the last year. There were nights I won 10 grand, only to lose it all in about 3 hours. This happened 3 times. 3 times, can you imagine? Can you imagine winning 10 grand and not telling anybody, but waste it all in 3 hours on a game? 

&amp;#x200B;

I was actually pretty happy a year ago. I had (and still have) an amazing girlfriend that thinks I'm her hero, I've got a loving home with parents that take perfect care of me. They are the ones that saved up 2500 euro for me. That 2500 euro lasted me all but one night.

I've got nowhere to go, nowhere to run. Christmas is coming up and my girlfriend and family expect me to buy presents. I mean, why wouldn't I? I work on the weekends and just sold everything expensive I own, I must have a fair amount of money right? I've managed to keep all of this a secret during the last year, but I can't do it anymore. 

You should feel me tense up when somebody mentions money. When my girlfriend takes my phone to check something. If my girlfriend finds out she would be so disappointed, she's perfect with money, she's saving up, buying cheap food, not going out to save more. And then there's me with 0.00 in my bank account and a 2000 paypal debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm in my room looking at my belt and thinking how quickly this could all be over. I could hang myself on the doorknob, and it would be all over. My dad would find me in the morning when he comes to check why I haven't waken up. He'd be alright, it's my mom I'm worried about. My dad would take care of her I guess. He would tell my girlfriend, he's a doctor so he's used to giving people bad news. She has lots of friends, they would without a doubt take care of her, better than I can at the moment I guess. It would work out eventually. I don't know anymore. It feels scary writing all this. Why man, why? It needs to stop. But it can't come out, it must never come out. I don't know anymore. I'm literally shaking, this is fucking pathetic.

My job will not support anything, I smoke pot to cope with depression, now I'm realizing I need to stop but the anxiety gets too much. I'm rambling. Everything still feels hopeless.",suicide
134844,"When ending it just seems pragmaticI won't go on and on about all of the specific shitty experiences that led me here to this sub.. i'm sure many have endured much greater hardships and heartbreaks than me, but let's just say that i've endured about a third-century of constant cringe-worthy humiliation and/or soul-crushing tedium.  it's non-stop and, frankly, unsustainable. I want it to end. 

I'm just bad at being a human being in general.. must be wired incorrectly or something (because i know it's been a problem since at least kindergarten).. low ambition/ desire to 'win'/conquer others.. inability to form 'bonds'.. just not good with people, friends, family, anyone.. just wanna be left alone.. never had a romantic relationship to speak of.. can't really hold down jobs.. often feel like i lack some basic tool-set (and drive) that most people gained naturally as adolescents. i can try and try my best to fake it, but it remains mysterious and forever out of reach to me.. and, if I do continue to live, then i will surely be forever alone (if the first 3+ decades are any indication). 

..add to that various other built-in problems like premature-ejaculation (trait inherited from my biological father apparently), tinnitus that's always been there (loud, constant, maddening static/tones blaring inside my skull), my now-advanced tooth decay/loss, and various increasingly-debilitating injuries (including a great many head injuries) and you have a recipe for a joyless lifetime that really isn't worth living. 

I've never really had a zest for life and have earnestly pondered ending it since at least 2nd grade (another child similar to me did it for real back then), but for at least eight years now i've been in a persistent suicidal mindset.. constantly fighting this back-and-forth battle inside me.. trying to stifle this urge that i feel.. thwart my own planning.. occasionally making feeble attempts and getting thrown into the looney bin, etc.. 

some days it isn't so bad, psychologically, but these days suicide seems to be more of a practical solution to a set of real-world problems than anything else. I simply haven't ever been able to fully support myself as an adult.. and i'm seriously doubting that i'll ever be able to do so. it's a matter of dollars and cents. even when i've (SOMEHOW) been able to hold down a job for more than a couple months I never seem to get anywhere.. just treading water barely, if that. during various periods of unemployment I've relied on a few friends and and my mom/adopted father that raised me, mainly. I don't want to be a financial/emotional burden on any of them, but I definitely would have been full-blown-homeless years ago if it had not been for their help. 

but, yeah, everything's coming to a head now. I've got no money at all.. got about a month left of crashing at this dudes house (probably my last friend) until kicked out.. some 89 year old driver ran a red light and rekt my shitty little car last november (but his insurance didn't cover anything).. so I don't have transportation (see: temp housing). 

in a month i've gotta leave this house, and then i dunno what to do. I don't want to move back into my childhood home.. again (if it's even still an option).. for, like, the 20th time.. it ends in really, really nasty quarrels that aren't good for anyone involved. 

so, that basically leaves suicide, trying to get into jail for room/board, or trying to hitch-hike to somewhere geographically that i could be a bum without freezing to death next winter and taking my chances at not-dying. i've spent the last 2 of 3 winters without heat, and that shit sucks, bad. I'm not very street-wise, though, and i'm sure i'd be raped or some shit after a short while. 

I just don't know what to do. life seems suuuper expensive, and i'll never be able to afford the basics (especially now that the govt is garnishing my wages for student loans for that art degree, hah). work seems like hell.. every single week of every single year until u physically can't anymore.. and it never, ever pays enough. I honestly don't know how everyone does it and stays sane. it's fucking crazy.. like..  born into this hellish world that wants me to spend alllllllll my goddamn time and energy, FOREVER, doing demeaning shit for people that don't like me for a PITTANCE.. i'm sorry, i dont know much about economics.. but if i'm gonna spend alllllll my goddamn time... maddening week in, maddening week out... forever... laboring, then it better AT LEAST cover my goddamn basic living expenses.. but it doesn't. my life is the epitome of unsustainable.. and I don't really have a burning desire to try to live through middle/old age with all of the constant pain and discomfort associated with having never been able to afford healthcare/dental here in america. 

idk, it's nice that subs like this exist.. that there's good-hearted folks out there willing to lend their ears and offer advice and words of encouragement, but, ultimately, what can any of us really do for anyone else? these problems are here to stay, and suicide seems like a practical move. No nice words can protect my body from the harsh elements, provide me with food my body needs to survive, or a new chewing surface with which to chew it. ",suicide
43779,"Hopeless...So I don't remember when my depression started it feels like forever..Im sure the main cause of it was my parents although I try not to blame them but I do.  My father would get into fits of rage when he was ""coming down"" from his high and would take it out on my mother and myself. He's broken my collar bone and my arm for no reason. He used to tell me he would kill me in my sleep so for a long period of time I lived in fear of almost everything.  I honestly wish it was just the physical pain I remembered but it's like I have these scars in my mind I can't get rid of.  This one night when I was 15 I was out drinking with some friends at the park, when I got home there was blood everywhere my dad broke into my moms room and just beat the living shit out of her I just lost it grabbed a shovel and went after my dad but my mom got in the middle and as blood and tears were running down her face she begged me to stop, she didn't call the cops cause she thought if she did it would make him even more angry. Well I ended up fighting my dad and kicking him out of the house. Once he was gone things were getting a bit better.  Btw I was raised catholic so I believed in forgiveness and we let him move back in with us a couple years later...what a huge mistake that was...he ended up having an affair and for some reason both my parents dragged me in the middle of it all. It was so embarrassing and heart breaking for me...anyways I moved to norcal to get away from everything but in sf I entered a world I wish I didn't I made friends with the wrong kind of people and just did drugs and fight alot. In the end it was all bullshit and fucked my view of life.  Those people I thought were my friends just used me. So now I just don't trust anyone.  I ended up losing all of my friends once I moved back in with my mom.  Was using drugs heavily at this point and I could see the pain it was causing my mother but I was to weak to stop.  the hate my father passed on to me is uncontrollable all I do is hurt those around me even though that isn't my intention. I ended up pushing away all the people who cared about me because of my negativity. Sadly now my mom And brother are the only ones who actually care whether I live or die but it's so hard for them in don't  want to be a burden I keep trying to convince myself I'd be doing them a favor killing myself...

297343,"Family Only Thing Keeping Me HereI've been thinking of suicide for a few years now, but I can't afford leaving my family without my financial and emotional support. My wife also is struggling with depression. We have two kids, and my life insurance wouldn't pay out if suicide were my cause of death. I've also been struggling with alcohol recently. I don't have a plan, but I've been imagining a lot of scenarios recently where my death would seem accidental.

It's weird, because I have a good job, we have enough money for our family, and my kids are great. Sometimes it all just feels overwhelming, and I just wish I weren't here. If I didn't have a wife or kids, I think I'd be gone already, but I'm afraid that someday I may feel selfish enough to go through with one of my plans.

Professional help is almost out of the question, as the blowback on my career would be too much. I want to keep doing the same job I'm doing, and I can't afford to have a mental health record. I've tried a few online services, but everyone just asks the same questions: Have you had thoughts of suicide, do you have a plan, have you asked for professional help, tried to distract yourself, etc. Not super helpful.

I won't tell my friends or wife, for the same reason that I won't talk to professionals - there's no real gain to be had by telling someone else, and there's too much to lose. My career, relationships, and social standing would all be impacted. I just want a way that I can deal with this by myself, if that exists.

It's probably dumb to think that reddit could be any real help. Probably just 1-2 responses telling me to call a hotline, talk to a friend, or get professional help.

170399,"It gets better...If you're going to end it what is a few more minutes?This is my tale through depression. I'm sharing in hopes that it may help some people.

Background: I grew up and live in southern Alabama, US. Growing up I was short and had a carefree attitude which made me a great target for bullying. Not to mention having a last name that included the word 'panty'. Have fun with that. So for 12 years I was verbally bullied and for a year physically. Actually got beat up for my lunch money. But in 11th grade I met a girl. Didn't start out as love but we started spending a lot of time together and started dating. She was my rock then. My 12th grade year, my mother moved away for a job in another state. (parents divorced by the way, evil step-mother who was verbally and physically abusive on occasion.) So that left me living with my grandmother. She then became ill and moved in with my aunt not far away. So living in a house by myself, working 40 hours a week sometimes, paying bills and still in high school. But at least I had my girlfriend. After high school, I didn't have a high GPA so I decided I'd go in the military to pay for school. Thought I could get a base close by as to not be too far away from home. Yeah..no. As far continent-ally as I could be from home. So about two years in and an engagement ring later, she breaks it off over the phone. This is the real start of it all.

Spiral:  I didn't tell any of my friends for a few weeks cause I couldn't bring myself to accept it. I finally did and a friend dragged me out to a party off base and I ended up going home with a mother of two(divorced) and instead of that being it, I attached what feelings that were left hanging with my ex-fiance to the new girl. We date for a while and I get deployed so we take a break. 

After I get back, we continue to see each other but we weren't official. I take leave and head home for a couple of weeks. While home over the course of a weekend she goes and meets a guy and gets engaged in the same weekend! Tripped me the fuck out. Ended up sleeping with a married friend who I found out later became pregnant but had a miscarriage. Get back off leave and I start cutting myself. If you've been in that state and feel those endorphins kick in, it's the only real feeling you feel. Then to fuck up my head even further I start having oral sex with the mom, whose engaged, and I'm sleeping in the same bed as her. Her fiance lived a couple hours away. And I ask her to marry me if it doesn't work out with this guy. Very classy right? I saw a military psych and he was useless. Well as you guessed it it didn't work out and then we got married. So now I have two step children, a wife, and an ex-fiance whom I'm still madly in love with at the time too. My new wife has her tubes tied so no chance of kids. Find out my ex-fiance is pregnant. Another mental blow. Find out my friend was pregnant with my child but had a miscarriage. And another mental blow. 

Due to the force shaping program implemented by the Air Force at the time, I get transferred into the reserves back close to home. So now I have to uproot my step kids and my wife to take them from Washington st. to Lower Alabama. Try fitting a wife, two kids, a dog, four cats, and two rats into an Explorer and making it cross country...So we make it home. Finding jobs sucked at the time. Hurricane Ivan had just blown through and a job to support the family that would leave me weekends for the reserves was very hard to find. But we had my family to help. 

Found a job in A/C heat business and worked myself into the hospital. Viral ulcers in my throat, couldn't eat or drink. Lost 15 pounds in a week though. Changed jobs to a line cook and moved to a neighboring town. Relationship got worse. We got to the point where she asked for a divorced. I had thought about it yeah, but I wanted to make it work and she didn't. Also around this time I started hanging out with some high school friends that also included my ex-fiance(still in love with) and her husband. We would all, including the soon to be ex-wife, go out drinking and dancing and my ex would dance/slow dance with me. Just made me think I'd have a chance with her again or at least be with her on the side. I wanted it more than anything. Soon after I started smoking pot with one of my co-workers to help deal with it. The wife left for a weekend to go see her new boyfriend in Virginia(while we are still married) and more or less gets engaged while there. She leaves on our two year anniversary and all I have is a bag of weed...Not bad while you're high. 

If I didn't mention before I have bad anxiety issues and pot was the only way to deal with it since I had no insurance or money to see a doctor. 

Dated and slept around a little. Did some drugs. Did MDNA once and I felt level for the first time in a long time. Just before my ex-wife left and after, I started to hear a voice in my head. It would say, ""Just kill yourself. There's no reason to still be alive. You're not even worth it."" And so many nights alone just holding a knife to my wrist. 

I got set up on a blind date with my now wife. It went good and we started dating shortly after that. After six months into the relationship I didn't need pot anymore. Things were getting better. eight months in, ""I'm pregnant."" So we ended up getting married a year to our blind date. She was in college at the time and I finally started college. So newlyweds with a kid and both in college. A financial nightmare. 

I started having seizures. Complex Partial in my temporal lobe. You know that place where the memory is? So my memory isn't too sharp anymore. Took a while to get the seizures under control. Failed a semester because of it. Medical bills piling up. Luckily had some mild insurance at the time. Seizures under control finally and we move into our first house and have a mortgage. Wife dropped out of college and got a full time job. Enter kid number 2. Two kids, a wife, and a mortgage and all that plus full time college student and working 20 hrs a week. My anxiety reached a high point and my depression gradually worsened.

Gets bad again: I would have up and down days. My up days were days I  didn't constantly think about killing myself. And my bad days...didn't go to my classes, maintained a C avg as best as I could, and tried to see a psych at the college, but professor sessions were $500 a pop or $5 dollars for a student to talk to you. And she was useless. Funny story I took one of their tests and it didn't know what I was mentally. I wasn't lying, but I wasn't stable lol. 

So sadly and regretfully I started having an affair with a co worker, and a lady who ran a pizza joint just down the shopping strip, and a fellow classmate. I only had sex with the classmate but made out and fingered the other two. And that made me hate myself more. Then my wife found out about the classmate and I confessed. She doesn't know about the other two. But after a rough patch, we got through it. 
   
My ex-fiance would come into my store I worked at on occasion and I would still get the biggest anxiety attacks. It was hard enough to think about her much less see her. I finally got in contact with her a while ago and was able to talk some things out with her. and even after that it still took several months to finally come to the emotional realization that it was over between us. Nine years...nine years in love with a person, unrequited-ly. 

The good: I'm married to someone who loves me and have two kids. Still have financial problems but steadily working on that. I have been as low emotionally as I can imagine, wanting to kill myself. Went through bouts of all I could think about was killing myself. Held a knife to my wrist too many times. Made small cuts, made bigger cuts elsewhere. 

My point is that it can take a decade, but it will get better. Also, I don't believe in destiny or fate but life has a flow. If you let go and just drift, it makes for a nicer ride than if you fight it's flow like I did on several occasions. And even at those times I could feel the current against me, but I wanted to control my life. It's hard sometimes, but live life. If you can walk far enough in a desert, you will find an oasis.

I was really so excited to go this year but somehow I got the weekends mixed up and I just found out that it was today and I missed it.  I've been contemplating killing myself for the past two hours after finding out.  One of the reasons I moved to NYC was because I wanted to go to this event. I just moved here I feel like a failure for missing it and I'm really ashamed to admit to my friend that I missed it even thought they reminded me to go three weeks ago.

I've been trying to find a therapist in NYC and if anyone has any recommendations on how to go about it please tell me. I live in Brooklyn. And I can't contact my PCP because I don't have one.

Sometimes they‚Äôll go on to ask me where I see myself in 5 years and I usually can‚Äôt answer the question. Then they go on to ask where I see myself in a year and yet again, I feel like I can‚Äôt answer. So out of frustration and the person just simply wanting to get an answer out of me, they usually ask where I see myself tomorrow. I usually can give them a simple answer of what I have to do within the next 24hrs which typically entails my work schedule for the next day. Most of the time they‚Äôll be satisfied with my response. After answering these questions I try to play it off as saying the reason I don‚Äôt know what my future looks like is because I like to live in the moment. That‚Äôs a lie, the reason I can‚Äôt see a future is because I truly don‚Äôt believe that I have one. One day, I think I‚Äôm going to get so fed up of my pathetic life that I‚Äôll just end it. I don‚Äôt make anything out of my life because I don‚Äôt see the point. I don‚Äôt see it getting any better and I don‚Äôt think I can be helped. I guess I‚Äôm just hoping something will come along, like a wave catching a piece of drift wood in its current and carrying it somewhere safe, like a beautiful beach. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm still hanging around. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs keeping me here. I feel selfish taking my own life because I know how much it hurts to lose someone you love but at the same time, nobody understands how much I‚Äôm hurting. If people could only see why I feel the way I feel, they wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to make the decision of ending it.

I‚Äôm pushing people who love me away because the further they get from me the less I can hurt them. The lonelier I am, the better. I destroy these relationships and I am always to blame which is good, I guess. The more you hate someone, the less you care about their life. 

Sometimes I get the feeling that I want to make things right. It‚Äôs like cleaning a dirty car window. I feel relieved when I do it and I can see where I‚Äôm going but after driving a few kilometres, the window is dirtier than before and I haven‚Äôt got the tools or energy to clean it. So why do I even try anymore. Why drive the car and why clean the window? I know that it will always revert to being dirty.

I no longer see any reason to do that, every where I turn is just another problem that I should have dealt with that has intensified into a huge flaming mess. What's left of the friend/family that is still talking to me would be better off without me. I mean the one's not watching and laughing at me with a bowl of popcorn on their laps waiting for my next abortive, spastic move.
   I've tried meds, therapy, electro shock, even the physicians here have compassion fatigue regarding me.
   I am supposed to be out of my house by 2/3, the landlord has decided to sell it, they didn;t give us(myself and my 90 year old mother) much time, just over Christmas(notifying me on the 15th, after I had spent money for stuff for what is probably my Mom's last Christmas). Ironically, it will be my last too. So I only had one month to raise $$ and that's not gone well either.  I have a house full of things from 2 households, Mom will barely part  with anything.
   So on the 3rd there is going to be some huge clusterfuck where I am supposed to have been moved out but due to my now crippling depression and anxiety and numerous physical ailments(I'm 57) I have hardly gotten anything done. 
   I've called everyone. 211, APS(hoping they could place my Mom but at long as I am here and not in hospice or something they expect for me to do everythng).
    I would have been gone long ago if not for my cats, they're of course blameless in this and do not deserve to have anything bad happen to them, I love them and they are precious but I can't continue. I can't fucking continue to try and be kicked down, crushed, over and over. I feel like I am hemorrhaging but it is invisible but  every where is sharp and pointy and draws blood.
All they offer to do is baker act me(Fl) where they will just lock me up and just throw meds at me while every thing goes to hell on the outside. They(primarily the nurses) are also cruel to me. The last time I went, a nurse there asked me why I didn't go to another hospital? Well, I was brought to that hospital by the police and it's only one of 2 hospitals in the county  and the only one with behavioral health. I used to be a nurse so that's especially painful.That's far from the only example.There's just no place for me. I believe that I have done everything that I could to get well but it just ain't happening.   I am hoping by writing this reddit can possibly make it easier for my Mom and cats somehow. After years and years of enduring this I just can't do it anymore. I know that I am far from blameless in this but my intentions were good, I apparently just  don't know how to do anything and I'm just getting worse at it.  Edit; I have sent my landlord an urgernt email begging for another month(we'll pay rent of course) so that I can get help and maybe come out of this. I really don't want to die, I just don't see any other choice.

I said that it was all my fault and was assured that it couldn't have been, but the truth is that it really was. I was emotionally abusive and at least once accidentally hit him when I just meant to push him away.

I still love him more than anything, but I did the usual ""right thing and deleted him from Facebook, started working out to exhaustion, etc. He still talks to me on IM once in a very long while and I'm cordial, but distant when he contacts me. It's extremely difficult, though, and just seeing his username makes me feel a sudden, uncomfortable tightness in my chest that lasts the whole day. It also seems like he only talks to me to tell me subtly how much better his life is than mine.

Yesterday would have been our third anniversary. I was planning on ordering a tank of nitrous oxide and a gas mask to breathe it in with, but I couldn't do it. I could barely even cry.

I feel like I've become estranged from reality. Nothing makes sense any more. I feel like the fundamental nature of reality is somehow illusory, but I can reason that this is not the case, or at least impossible to tell.

I can't believe I treated the man I loved more than anything in the world so poorly that he stopped loving me and never wants to even see me again.

I'm not depressed, I don't think so anyway, but I always find myself sad. I was born in a dirt poor family in a third world country. So poor that my younger sister and I would go days without eating anything. I grew up with an abusive father that once tried to kill me by smashing my head against a wall when I was 9. He would physically abuse my mom on a daily basis. He broke her arm, he would kick her, spit her etc. She never left because of religious reasons.

The nightmare ended when my father died of a sudden heart attack. I was so happy that day... I remember crying tears of joy. I felt free and motivated, but money was still a very big issue for us, so I would go and help around in my village doing manual labor, it was exhausting but I didn't care, my family had something to eat and I was able to go to school. I wanted to be successful and make my mom proud.

Despite being average, I worked harder than all my classmates. I worked myself physically and mentally to exhaustion every day. And it worked, I got into a good college and was able to work part time jobs. When college finished, I managed to land my dream job and I was making a lot of money, I got my drivers license, bought a car, moved my family to the city, started going to the gym and I felt like I made it in life.

But life isn't that easy or fair. In the past few years my life has been a living hell. My sister died in a car crash. My mom has dementia, heart issues and is unable to stand for more than a few seconds. I have to take care of her, she's my only family left and seeing her in this state makes me break down. I lost my job, and because I focused too much on building a career I have no social life. No friends. All my romantic relationships ended very quickly. Nobody to talk to. My side business failed. I lost most of my savings and investments. I tried so hard... So fucking hard, and then it all comes crashing down. I came into this world a sad dirt poor loser and it seems I'll leave the same.

I just can't keep going forward. Why should I? I have nothing. The only person keeping me from killing myself is my mom, but once she's gone I'll most likely attempt suicide. 

I'm sorry for this long rant, I just feel that if soneone reads what happened to me it'll make me feel some sort of closure, even if it's only brief.",suicide
214747,"The signs to look out forWhere I am, it's nearly the end of 10th September, World Suicide Prevention Day. So, I just wanted to say, to anybody who's struggling with thoughts of suicide, or with a loved ones suicide or attempted suicide; you're not alone. Here are some things to look out for in yourself and others to determine suicidal behaviour and thoughts:

**Actual attempts or serious thoughts:** I have thought about suicide a lot in my past, and have two serious attempts to my name. I say serious because I have overdosed and done other stupid things many more times, with the thought of dying not scaring me. If you or somebody you know are known to have attempted suicide or talked about it in the past, they are statistically more likely to try (or try again, if you/they have before), so stay vigilant and don't be afraid to ask them if they're thinking of suicide.

**Risk-Taking behaviour:** Someone thinking about taking their life might actively seek death by taking risks that could harm them, without them doing it themselves. I've taken part in risk-taking behaviour, such as running into a knife fight to try and stop it. Ironically, I did actually stop it and the two parties involved walked away from each-other. That was the second time I've purposely gotten into a fight. I know it's sometimes seen as 'heroic' when one does that, but for me it was a matter of seeing something risky and going headfirst into it. Of course, I'm empathetic too and I really don't like people getting hurt, if it's not me. If you or someone is taking too many risks, it can be a serious sign that they aren't caring for their life.

**Increased drug use:** Drug use is often seen in people with suicidal thoughts. They may have been prescribed medication for a mental health problem or may seek medication for what comes with mental health problems such as insomnia. It's often part of risk-taking, and they may like the 'high' it gives them, getting them out of depression temporarily. For me simply being relieved of anxiety was amazing, then it turned into a habit. That happened with almost any drug I tried thereafter- I liked the temporary high, the buzz, the confidence boosts. It turned me into a different person however, and the more I took drugs the more I pushed away my friends, family, and sanity. In the end, I was more depressed because of lack of money and the toll it took on my life, which gave me more suicidal thoughts. Drug use should be looked out for, and if somebody is addicted, they may have suicidal thoughts; as well as somebody with suicidal thoughts may become addicted. 

**Giving away personal items or saying personal things:** A serious sign to look out for is if somebody offers you their prized possessions, or money. They may be getting rid of their personal affects ready for taking their life. They may say words or phrases that don't seem right and could indicate their thoughts. Things like ""I love you, you know that."" or ""I'll never forget everything you've done for me"", in random moments may be worrying signs they are thinking of it. If you get random texts or messages where somebody may be apologising for something or telling you their affection for you; ask if they're okay and if you can call them. Better still- if you can see them. Watch out for them tidying away their stuff or making any secret notes or letters. Will-writing when they're still young, or thinking/talking about their wishes for their funeral or after death. When I was actively suicidal I wrote my note on word and stuck it on a memory stick, which I had ready on my desk along with a folder with some personal notes in and my birth certificate, national insurance, bank details etc. so it would be easier on my family. I also packed up a lot of things in my room and even after the failure, I kept things packed knowing I'd likely try again because it is what I wanted. Watch out for any of that. 

**These are just the most worrying signs,** people thinking of suicide may also talk about it a lot, or completely ignore the topic even if it's brought up. They may have casual feelings toward death like they're not worried by it, which can indicate a certain lust for it- but not always. **They might have a drastic change in behaviour, perhaps they were once optimistic and happy people, but seem 'darker'.** There might be something going on in their lives so never assume somebody is immune to depression or suicidal thoughts. **Extreme calmness is another, big thing to look out for.** Where someone may have been deeply depressed or always talking about ending things or not seeing a way out, they may now be calm and seemingly happy out of nowhere. This is very common when somebody has chosen to end their life, because they feel like everything is temporary. I became very calm and very giddy when I thought my life was to end soon, because I knew I was untouchable and anything that happened would be nothing, very soon. I actually became confident and wanted to see my friends and talk to my family, everything was sorted and I had nothing to worry about.

**Lastly,** if somebody is sleeping a lot more, or a lot less than usual, they may be depressed. This goes for somebody who has a sudden loss of appetite and doesn't seem to want or enjoy food. Or they might be hungry and binge on food. Depression can come in many forms so if you suspect anybody is depressed please reach out. It might not always mean suicidal thoughts but people with depression are more susceptible to them, so if you know somebody with this or other mental illnesses, look out for them and these signs. 

**Stay safe, stay strong, stay here.**

I look in the mirror and Isee an old, wrinkled, fat lady. It's hard for me to accept that I'm not attractive anymore. I feel even my husband isn't attracted to me anymore, which is understandable. I have two sons and I feel selfish when I think about suicide. ",suicide

Just yesterday when we were supposed to have a little swimming party with friends when her mom suddenly banned her from going. She(my friend) told us that her mom allowed her to go the day before, but she(her mom) was surprised to see her dressed up and ready to go on the day of the party and consequently didn't allow her to come.

She managed to slip by her mom and asked her older brother to come with her and meet with us but when we saw her she was really, really sad and cried. She made an excuse to see us but wasn't coming with us. Good thing her brother was a nice guy and he promise to let her catch up with us later. She did come and we were both happy and all but still, I'm concerned about her. 

When we tell each other stories she often says things like her mom doesn't believe in her, they often get into fights, etc. I'd like to talk to her more but since it's our Xmas vacation I can't go to her place(we often go to her's after school), plus she can't go online very often, and she doesn't have her own number(she broke her SIM out of anger yesterday).

142974,"Lost my health insurance. Hospitalized 3 times this year. Lost and feel like nothingI didn't receive recertification paperwork, probably because I moved within the past year. Yes, I notified them. (Medicaid) I had united as my managed care plan. My psychiatrist gave me a break for this month but won't see me next month without united and even if I can fix medicaid tomorrow, which isn't possible, I can't get united back until Dec. 


I received the cancelation notice but didn't open it until it was too late to request a fair hearing in time to keep my health insurance. (Four days too late) I was crying hysterically on the phone and the lady just told me ""good luck"" in a very bitchy tone and hung up on me. I called back and spoke to her again and told her it was very triggering after I explained my story and I asked her if I should just call 911 because I'm suicidal and she told me to call medicaid. 


I've been planning a suicide for a few weeks since I found out I lost my insurance. I nixed it when my doctor said he would see me but after today I'm just ready to give up. I'm agoraphobic and I have trouble getting out in the first place. 


I faxed all the paperwork to them but that seems irrelevant. I was hospitalized 21 days over the summer for being suicidal, but I had my insurance. I can't go back to a shitty hospital which I was in before because it doesn't help one bit and just makes things worse because I end up a zombie and dysfunctional. At least I'm semi functional after this hospitalization, which took united.


I'm lost. And no one can help. I felt useless to begin with. I felt like a spec in the universe and now I know I am. Literally no one in this state can give a rat's ass about me. They want more doctor's notes for things when I don't have insurance. I don't know how to pay for my medications this month. I'm just going to go off the wall anyway, I might as well bite the bullet before I get manic or something and end up with a ton of bills for my family.

94523,"Why shouldn't I just jump in front of that train ?This is my first and maybe my last post on reddit, you can totally ignore this, it is not going to matter, I just want to put some stuff off my chest.
Here I go, I lived a happy life back in my hometown in Romania, then it all went to sh*t when I moved to the U.K.. I honestly have most of the things a teenager would want (I am 16, sorry if it seems like I am bragging). Got a phone, a PC, everything but my friends.
I moved here 2 years ago, this summer I went on holiday back to my hometown and I met ""that special person"" again, I felt true happines for that 1 month I was there, I cried of happines everynight knowing that next morning I would wake up and go meet her, actual happines, do you know what that feels like ? And of course, because I am fat, ugly, have glasses, I would never have had a chance with her, but she talked to me, we would text eachother until we will meet, I would tell her everything, literally everything about me, my darkest secrets, she did the same. 
Now I've got my GCSEs (for those who don't know, they are the exams that decide your future in England), failing everything (even though I was an ace in everything back in Romania and the stuff I do here is easier), i just can't do anything, just can't. I feel like breaking down crying everyday in the hallway when passing anyone. No one makes me feel like she does, she doesn't have a boyfriend or anything, if she did I would be more happy because she would be more happy, but the fact that I am the way I am and I look the way I look is going to stop her from ever thinking about me. She only treated me like that this summer after telling her my past attempts of.. you know( let's not say the ""s"" word) It was all fake, it fu**ing hurts.
It is not all about her, not all about love, my friends that I've known since I was 4  I miss them.
Let's go to the train thing, I think I might be boring you right now. I live in West London next to a train station, I take the train everyday, why shouldn't I just jump in front of one of those that go like 300km/h on Monday ? I don't care if no one will recognise me or stuff like that, i just want to end it, but a part of my brain stops me from it.
I can't tell my parents, they will take it as a joke, can't tell anyone at school because f*** them, they don't care.
Also my parents told me we will never go back to Romania so...
There is just no one I can talk to, but her.
Yeah,let's go back to her, to Beatrice, what a beautiful name isn't it ? She is also beautiful, not in the sexual way, I am not that kind of person, she is just gorgeous, you are gorgeous Beatrice, you will never know it, I never told you, but I love you and always will.
I decided, on monday I will do it, I will jump in front of it, first day of school after 2 weeks of holidays, not like anyone will care anyway, not even her.

330380,"I resisted temptation today!So I was put on an antidepressant for my postpartum depression (and lingering depression from before my pregnancy). I stopped taking it for awhile. I started taking it again 3 days ago (it takes 2-3 days to kick in) and I have been feeling my symptoms come back. It is harder for me to become happy. I am so irritable. I can't relax. It doesn't help that I can't see my husband the past few days. I know it isn't from that because my depression symptoms always affect my relationship with him and I saw him today for an hour and things were different. The earliest I can see my doctor is tomorrow. 

Sometimes I just want to yell at one of my kids, smack her, and throw her across a room. But I didn't. I have an immense amount of self-control. A lot of times I even surprise myself.

I have Xanax for my anxiety, although if I take it at all, it is usually before I go to bed so that I can sleep. Today my anxiety is high, but I left it at home because I thought I wouldn't need it. I just got home and I just took it. Hopefully it will kick in soon.

I picked up my stepdaughter today, on the way home I picked up my younger son from my in-laws' place. I had to get a few groceries for my stepdaughter. We went to the store, and being a supermarket, it also has alcohol. I was so tempted to just pick up a 6-pack of Smirnoff coolers (raspberry is my favorite). I could have easily drunken them all myself. It is just me and the kids at home. Nobody would know. I was afraid that if I started drinking that I wouldn't be able to stop at the appropriate time. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to take care of my baby when he woke up, and I was afraid that I would sleep so deeply that I wouldn't be able to hear him at all...

Good news! They didn't have any raspberry flavor (seriously, guys, try it if you haven't) and it is much easier to drink quickly (which is what I wanted) when I have those coolers than anything else. I wasn't in the mood for the other flavors (and the good part of me was still stopping me), so I didn't buy any of it.

Honestly, I have other alcohol in the house and I have more Xanax that I can take to calm down and relax. With it just being me and the kids, I am not going to drink and I am not going to take more Xanax than prescribed. It is still very VERY tempting to do so.

335756,"I have been having suicidal thoughts lately and I want the pain to go away.I feel like I have no control of my life. I am a first year medical student and I am a month into the curriculum and my depression is at an all time low. We are officially in the full swing of things and I started off on the wrong foot. I barely passed my first exam because I couldn't figure out how to study and all tests are cumulative so I need to master this old material if I want to recover. But at the same time I can't keep up with the work they're unleashing onto me. I am not prepared for the next one. I knew coming into school that I probably won't be top of the class anymore because everyone in medical school is smart, but I didn't expect being so low on the class ranking. It's been wrecking my morale.

&amp;#x200B;

My support system has also been really weak. My friends never reach out to me and my family never understands the intensity of school. They keep asking me to come home to visit them, but I can't because of my workload. I try to explain to them the issue, but they just get mad and think I'm purposely avoiding them. They're not paying for anything, it's all loans for me. I've tried reaching out to my friends that I'm stressed, lonely, anxious, etc but they half ass their support and it's making me feel worse. It makes me feel like I am all on my own. I kind of have new friends here, but I don't feel entirely comfortable with them. My classmates are already hooking up with each other and drama is starting. It's all too fast for me right now. I hate drama. I take relationships slow, but it's to my expense because people form strong friend circles without me because I don't participate in the gossip. Plus I have to study alone because if I'm in a group setting I get distracted and can't retain anything, but that's also to my expense because I miss out on forming friendships if I am alone all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I also ruined one of my most meaningful friendships this past summer before starting school. She was my best friend, someone I used to share everything with and she shared with me everything in her life. I don't feel like telling the story because it upsets and frustrates me each time I tell it, but basically we both liked each other, but at different times (she was first, I was second), and we ended up hurting each other. It was easily the worst heartbreak I've experienced. Probably the first girl to genuinely make me cry. We tried reforming the friendship but it doesn't feel the same. I feel so secondary to her now. She doesn't reach out to me anymore, she doesn't check up on me, and she keeps doing these extremely kind gestures to everyone else in her life but me. I can't even get a ""how have you been?"" text. No hint that I still matter to her or mean something to her anymore and it breaks my heart.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I feel overwhelmed about school, I feel like I have no support system or just an extremely unstable one, and I can't get over the worst heartbreak I have experienced in my entire thus far in my life. And it's only going to get worse because medical school isn't easy. I am not happy, I worked so hard to get here with hardly any help, but now that I am here I still am not happy. I try reaching out to people about my stress, anxiety, depression, etc, but they half ass their support and sometimes will just stop replying to me or checking up on me if I vent to them. I don't even ask for advice, I tell them straight up I just want someone to cheer me on, but they still don't do that. I feel so alone, unwanted, unsupported at one of the most difficult stages in my life so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been having suicidal thoughts because I've had depression/melancholy since high school and I have never been truly happy. It feels like an all time low right now because of my lack of support and loneliness. Even if friends and family were there for me, they're 300 miles away. I don't know if these suicidal thoughts are real or are fantasies that if I ever off'd myself, people would realize how much they neglected me and that I did matter to them or something. But I don't know if it's real or un-relievable stress.",suicide

I am thinking of killing myself, everyday I am depressed and I can't eat or sleep, I cry all the damn time and I feel so alone and worthless right now, I cared about her and looked out for her always but she says I am a liar and a manipulator and that I hurt her, I don't have any friends and hardly any family, she was my entire world, my entire life
and now she never wants to see me again and doesn't care about me.........I want her back, I don't know what to do, I feel like I want to die, maybe if I told her that she would at least become my friend ?

I used to have someone who made every day better, I was happy then but they're gone now. They never really cared about me and now I know that the happiest period of my life was nothing but a lie. I loved her more than anything in the world and now I don't think I'll ever be able to feel the same way about anyone again.

I've wasted my life sitting alone, hunched over in front of a computer instead of getting out there and living my life. I've never been to a party, gotten drunk, hooked up with someone and it feels like if I don't soon I never will. But I don't know how, I don't know anyone who would let me tag along or make sure I'm doing it safely and I'll end up spending the rest of my life regretting having never had these experiences.

I've been in such a bad place these last few months hat I've fucked up the rest of my life too. My grades have all dropped and I've missed the deadline for my university applications anyway so I'm essentially just thrown my life away. My entire family is disappointed in me because they all believe I could've done so well for myself but none of them understand how badly I'm struggling with everything.

I have nothing to live for anymore. I can't fall in love anymore, I'll spend my life wishing I was someone else and any chances of getting my dream job are down the drain.

I just want all the pain and hopelessness to go away. I want to stop being miserable and the only way I know how is to stop living altogether. I'm planning on doing it next weekend, after I settle a few things first. Then I can finally be free.",suicide

I went to a trade school and walked out with a certificate of pc service and support. Problem is that I live in a rural area 2 hours outside any major city centre and have failed to get my drivers 8 times now. I even passed drivers training but flunked the actual road test. Everytime I take it I keep fucking up. Yet I know that if I don't get my drivers i'm going to be stunted for life, so why don't i just end it all and blow my brains out? 

The problem arises in my family. You see they happen to have deluded themselves into thinking that I have potential and am destined to actually move out of my mothers basement. I know that if I finally man up and splatter the cieling with my gray-matter that it would destroy mymother which would make life significantly harder for my two younger brothers aged 18. My younger brothers are more succesful so I dont know my my mother hasnt written me off as defective and moved onto coddling my siblings instead.

I know Christmas is a time of year that is very hard on people and suicides happen more often.

273679,"big confession for me Not really a confession as I made a post of this before, but I just wanted to update you guys from my last post where I talked about how I've always felt really miserable (I don't want to say depressed, I never got this diagnosed so I don't want to say anything like that) and that I've been having absolutely terrible dreams about stuff

Dreams about stuff I've never seen before

They started in grade 4 (9 years old) with actually, pretty normal dreams. Just like normal dark hallways and zombies and stuff.

As I got older (13) I really started getting the gorey stuff

A mans genitals getting punctured with a screwdriver

The entire human race commiting suicide from a 10 story high building

people getting crushed and exploding under trucks

a child getting their eye punctured

etc

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to come off as one of those r/im14andthisisedgy kids, but I really don't know what to do

It's been happening every day now for the past 4 years (ALMOST 5) and I really really really hate this kind of stuff

I've never been comfortable around gore for obvious reasons, and me having these dreams aren't helping one bit! I'm having trouble sleeping (not insomnia, not that severe) and some days I even fear the bed, not knowing what kind of dream I'm going to have

r/FiftyFifty is a sub I found out yesterday only, it definitely is not from that as I said, this has been happening for years now

My question? My main question is is this normal, or am I just being really edgy? I don't know about edgy, because this is something I cannot control and just keeps happening off and on, but please let me know if it is.

On my last post, some pretty awesome people (that's a MASSIVE understatement) helped me out a little bit by telling me to go to a therapist and such, but I don't really know about that

My main fear about someone finding this out is my parents. I don't want them thinking I'm a troubled kid, or that I need extra protection, or that I'm simply and plain a scaredy cat.

91105,"How can I further help my girlfriend get the help she needs?I first posted this in r/relationship_advice but this sub seems better for this topic.

My girlfriend has clinical depression. She goes into a depressed unmotivated state for weeks if not months on end but I usually manage to lift her mood and/or mental state. Previously she has had multiple suicide attempts during the time period I was not dating her and did not know her but they all failed.

I have looked on various government and private medical websites about how to help someone who is suicidal, such as TELL and others but they don't help with the situation because I already know she is suicidal, and I listen to her needs and problems and I try to be supportive and optimistic. She used to not always be suicidal when she was younger, but as she has grown older the depression has only gotten worse and worse. She said she does not know if she's going to have enough energy to live past 20, and she said she thinks she will commit suicide once she finishes high school. We are both very young.

I have tried to comfort her and tell her things will be better, but she is not optimistic about it. Combined with her studies being with her parents and siblings in the quarantine is only making her more stressed out.

I have suggested to her that she go see a physician but she's scared of going to the doctor.

Her mom has helped somewhat, making her do counseling sessions every other week with a school counsellor with a health background (I am not sure who the counsellor is or what their qualifications are).

She has not been able to be completely honest with the counsellor, saying she is studying when she actually doesn't have the motivation to do anything. Her counsellor said she does not have depression because of this, and said she probably just has ADD. Her sister does, and that's a possibility as well but I truly believe she has clinical depression. The counsellor also did not recommend anti-depressants due to the side effects. She is very distraught and wants to stick to her original story to not make the counsellor think she's changing her story just to get anti-depressants.

She says that she does not want to live anymore, and that dying would be a great release for her. The only reason she has not committed suicide is because she is more afraid of failing to commit suicide.

Her mother has told her she's not thinking of getting anti-depressants since its not a cure for clinical depression, and this attitude has been passed onto her as well.

She has also tried to use many suicide hotlines, but she finds that they don't help. Not only that but she generally does not want me to go out of my way to help her because that makes her feel worse about herself for making other do something for her.

She does not want me to contact her parents or contact her counsellor, she will not give me the contact to her counsellor, and said she will kill herself if I try to do so.

I don't know how to help her, so if you have any ideas that would be great. If you need more info I will be happy to answer.",suicide

Their lungs had not collapsed, merely continued functioning as normal. Fish of all shapes and colors meandered near them, as if the pair weren't there. The Woman in Blue reached out to touch a pale red fish. It was small, and showed lack of fear to her touch. It had green stripes along it's back, slightly glimmering within the little light that reached the bottom of the ocean. The man stood still, taking the ocean in with all of it's beauty. He stared into the distance, patiently watching a fish that had a beak-like mouth, it slowly swam towards him. The woman in blue held the man's hand, as she had been all along. They walked together, sand being kicked up all around them, slowly coming to block their view. As they walked, a figure thrashed under their feet out of site, obscured by sand. They fell to their stomachs, yet as they looked upwards, they felt free. Looking leftwards, a vast coral reef crawled past them. Decorated in colors such as, blue, green, purple, and many more. The tubes shooting outwards in every direction, as if it were slowly consuming the ocean. They looked downwards at the large manta ray carrying them deeper into the ocean. The ray brought them past the dropoff, the bottom of the floor no where in sight. They sailed for some time, the ocean greeting them as an old friend. They drifted into what must have been the center of the ocean, where a large colony of fish had sat. The rainbow shot over their shoulders. The ray brought them downwards, deeper into the ocean, inviting them to stay longer. As they came to rest on the gentle sea floor, they were greeted by many strange creatures. Such as a fish with a man's head, the tail being sleek and long. Another one being a sea dragon, it's head somehow feminine, the scales along her being smooth and ruby-like, yet hard enough to cut even steel. The final creature was simple, a blob of smaller lifeforms, they all merged together to make the form of a dolphin. They had a glittery black sheen to them. The pair still holding each others hands took their first step into the unknown, accompanied by the strange fish. They walked, and walked, and walked. The fish guiding them to an unknown goal. Eventually they stumbled upon a large metal object. The man fish, the dragon, and the blob, all encouraged them to lift the oblong piece of metal. They slide their hands under easily; the metal felt soft to the touch. They lifting it effortlessly, below it, a void was uncovered. Slowly the ocean had drained, the creatures escaping downwards into it. The current left the pair untouched, as the majority of the world slipped out of site. Eventually no more of the ocean came, as there were no more of this sea to give, just a vast desert.",non-suicide

18316,"I don't really know where to post this, but this is the subreddit I'm most familiar with...To start off with this, I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and panic disorder...

My boyfriend came home from cleaning up the plane crash mess in Charleston, SC this past Friday. We were fighting the whole week over really stupid stuff, but it got resolved within hours of him returning home. 

But as we were talking about it, he exclaims, ""I don't know what to do here, I've never dated anyone who was bipolar before."" It kind of hit hard, in the moment. I don't think he meant harm by it or anything, but it hurt. I've posted on here before and expressed my suicidal thoughts, and wishing to go through with it. Usually I delete my posts because I see how whiney I sound.

Last night, I went downstairs to take medicine I take at night and saw all of my pill bottles, and my pill holder. I take 11 pills a day and for me, most of my life that's been my normal. So an excess of prescription pill bottles never bothered me.

Then it clicked. He's not used to that. He's in the Air Force and isn't on any prescription medication, his parents were never on any, it wasn't something he was used to seeing or dealing with.

I went upstairs to apologize that he had to deal with me, and my episodes, or when I think it's wise to just stop taking my medication. He started crying slightly and told me I never had to apologize for that. He told me that he fully expected me to be irrational again in the future, or jump to immediately breaking up without a thought. I don't want to break up with him, but when things get hard that's always my first thought. That he is better off without me.

For the most part, I'm pretty stable. When I'm taking my medicine correctly. 

But I'm still suicidal. It's not fair to be in a relationship when I know that in the back of my mind, every day, I'm just wishing to have the guts to end it. Is it?

To take my medicine and feel half of myself. To not, and get manic episodes, but knowing the depressive is around the corner and I'll be back on this subreddit spilling my thoughts to you guys, looking at my gun, looking at my medicine, trying to figure out which way is better for me to end my life.

 Last night, my girlfriend asked me if I have ever been suicidal. I have never, but I immediately felt concerned because I knew where the conversation was heading. She revealed to me that she has been suicidal before. I asked if she ever self-harmed and she told me she has considered it. She said that 3 years ago, she felt alone, she had a pair of scissors, and was thinking about stabbing herself in the stomach at the moment. When she told me this I just gave her a big hug and told her that she can always talk somebody and she could talk to me if she ever needed to. I honestly didn't know what else to say because we were out on a date and I didn't want to upset her by saying something she might not like. Even now as I write this, I recall her telling me that when she was in elementary, she threatened her schoolmates that were bullying her that she would kill herself. At the time when she told me this, I was shocked, but rationalized in my mind that she was probably lying so her bullies would back off. She said it in a kind of laughing tone and I assumed (stupidly) that she was all right. She exhibits some signs of depression. She asked me if my parents hated her after they met her and she has a pretty low image of her body.

This is where I need some advice. I really want to help her out because I really, really like her and would never leave her because of something like this. I've been reading some of the stuff on /r/SWResources but I'm not sure when/how to approach the subject. Do I just wait for her to bring this up again or should I offer her a chance to talk to me more about this before something serious ever happens? Thanks in advance.",suicide

I feel sorry for all the people who ever had to touch me because I'm utterly disgusting. Some of my friends hugged me in the past, and I feel guilty to this day.

I have one last friend who makes me hate myself even more. I send her plenty of messages every day because there's nobody else I could share my thoughts with, and she usually replies once every two or three days with one cold short sentence.

My roommate was convinced that i started day drinking (i dont) despite whenever she's home in the morning she smokes weed in her room. I know people worry about me, and i have a few people i care for too, but that doesn't seem like enough. Even when I'm with friends or when text people I always feel alone, and whenever i try moving on with life I get knocked down. I haven't tried killing myself because i dont see what that will accomplish, but also a bottle of sleeping pills mixed with some wine just sounds nice.",suicide

So, I am deleting all social media effective immediately.

319356,"What do I do now?I've struggled depression and anxiety since I was 10 and I used to frequently hurt myself. This was because I found child and rape pornography on my dads computer. Initially I suppressed what I'd seen but I suffered from anxiety, panic attacks and was terrified whenever he was home. He went to jail when I was 15 and I thought I'd get better because I moved out of the house and cut off all contact. 

I'm in my mid 20's now and I don't know why but the anxiety and panic attacks have stayed with me all these years. I don't really trust anyone anymore and because of that I distance myself from most people. I've been asked out a few times but I'm scared to be with anyone because I think if my own dad was capable of such terrible things why aren't other people. I try to stay optimistic but the more time goes on the more I realise I'm never going to really get better.

329118,"I am ready. It's not an easy decision, but it is the decision with the least risks.When I say risks, I mean mentally and emotionally. I am not a risk-taker, and that I have to live on for another day, risking that things will get worse and worse, terrifies me.   


I have seriously and genuinely sought for help from most everywhere and everyone, and the only one who can change my mind refuses to help me see the light at the end of the tunnel (and he is aware of that). I have talked to people from different helplines, been to therapy sessions, shared my stories with friends, etc. As I thought things couldn't get any worse, they did. Despite my wish of keeping my struggle with suicidal thoughts privately, a friend of mine outed me on social media, along with my mum, and as a result, I have been bombarded with messages and visits from people and the police, and it's been nothing but triggering, scary, uncomfortable and exhausting for me to endure. I think this has been the final push that I was searching for.  


Looking at my life, I am no longer looking at what the future holds anymore. Instead, I look back at my past, and I am satisfied with what I have been able to do, experience and achieve; and for that, I feel content and ready. I understand that people who know me will be upset and devastated, and I can do nothing but feel sorry for them. My entire life up until now, I have loved everyone with all my heart, and cared for everyone with all I have, so I hope people can see me as that person instead of as someone who has to take the difficult way out.  


Determination can be powerful, and after having no determination to live anymore, I feel more determined than ever to end it all. Obviously, this is just part of my story, but I thought I would vent somewhere, because I don't want to have anything left unsaid. My journal will, in addition, tell everyone about who I am, so I guess this is some sorts of a final goodbye to the world.   


I have not had a set date yet, but it is really bizarre feeling that I know that the day will come sometime very soon. Now that I have had all of my affairs in order, time to watch the final season of Gossip Girl.

My parents are never happy with my grades. They say they are terrible and only want me to have all 90 and says having 90 is just average.

My dad slaps me when he is really mad at me and mad when I say something rude and scares the crap out of me when he is around me as he always yells when I do something bad or have missing assignments. We got into fights about grades as they never congratulate me and they say that my grades will drop which is why they don't celebrate. They only care about final grades as we are only halfway through the first quarter of 10th grade.

My dad says I am the worst kid in the family as all family members score better than me with the most opportunities. Yesterday we got into a fight because my Spanish grade dropped from an 85 to a 78 and math dropped from 89 to 80 which rose back up to an 88 but my dad was not happy with that.

English is not my first language. So some of the things that characterizes me I believe are: depression, sensitivity, sluggish cognitive tempo (sct), social anxiety and asd(have diagnosis). I've convinced myself that my version of reality is warped and greatly limited compared to the average person. Dunno, maybe I'm just being delusional. I've completely abandoned my ego because possessing one takes me to a place I like to call the abyss. This basically gives me ignorant suffering. Okay, I'll try to explain this the best I can. Several regions of my brain appear to be inactive and it's always been like this since I've been born. Due to this and the things I've listed before, without sufficient self-awareness life can become quite miserable without me realizing it. I reject my experience of reality and started considering the possibility of everyone else being soulless except me. The perfect coping mechanism! I can't validate my version of the world or other people's existences. Even as I read your comments, it will literally turn into a feedback loop to be interpreted by my brain. So I pay close attention to my thoughts, feelings, inclinations, ambitions, point of view, emotions and basically reject them. I have this constant need for stimulation(think I may have inattentive adhd), otherwise I get bored, completely empty and start feeling really . Though denying the very core essence of my being requires so much brainpower due to things listed above, and due to poor memory, I start doubting my belief. All I want to do is turn into a recluse and live a life of self-indulgence completely cutting myself off of society for good.

A problem that I often have is falling victim to the flow of others (like a toddler). Have I lost a part of my psyche? I don't know what to believe, when to feel guility, when to feel happy, when to feel sad, what to consider an accomplishment. The world I know has been created thorugh the perspective of my mind. Something I deeply hate , and thus I am a forsaken existence. I can't communicate with the outside world due to the feedback loop thingy (Don't know how to interpret reality).

259498,"I need help.I don't know what I'm doing. I feel like my whole life is obsessively focused around food. If I'm not eating, I'm thinking about eating. I can't stop. I throw up multiple times a day. The worst part is I was recovered for 6 months up until July.

I worked so hard to establish healthy habits. But I went on vacation, indulged, gained weight, went through a lot of stress, and totally relapsed. It's been two months now and I am living in constant fear of dying or losing control over everything in my life.

I can't get anything done. I've put off finding a new job after graduating from college as well as studying for the GRE and applying to masters programs because I'm just in and out of the bathroom, shoving food into my face, watching hit the toilet bowl, weighing myself, and then doing it all again.

It's so toxic.

I don't talk to my therapists about it. I keep it a secret from my parents, who I live with, but they have to have some idea. My boyfriend desperately wants me to heal, but in the past when I tried to maintain a healthy lifestyle he would get frustrated when I didn't want to eat cheeseburgers and drink beer all the time because then he couldn't either.

Of course I told him he could on his own, but he didn't want to and we got into arguments over it. So I'm having a hard time. I don't know what the next step is. I'm sick of living in fear. I want to get help but I don't feel like I'm thin enough to warrant it; like somehow, I'm having an eating disorder the wrong way because I don't feel its effective.

All I want is to look in the mirror and feel good about myself. And to be happier than I am right now. This has been a painful month. And I'm afraid it's just going to keep getting worse.

I don't know who to turn to. I don't know how to break the habits I've established.

I don't know how to convince myself that I'm not entitled to just eat all the crap food I want in huge quantities and look the way I want to look. I feel that I should have the freedom to eat everything and maintain a low weight, like life owes that to me. And I know that's not true or fair or right. I'm just not sure where to move to with that information.

I'm afraid I feel terribly alone. And I'm afraid I'll slip into my old habits of eating nothing at all if I go at this the wrong way. I'm afraid of the initial weight gain that accompanies recovery as I've already dealt with that the first go around.

I want to make these changes for the right reason. I feel like wanting to live is a damn good one. But I am flaky. And I'm not sure how long I have to get started on this before I convince myself being thin is the only way I want to live, and anything short of that will have me wanting to be six feet under.",suicide
247778,"I almost did itSunday night I was up all night, couldn't sleep. I felt myself having so much anxiety because I knew I was seriously considering just getting it done already. I had planned everything out in my head - what exactly I was going to do. I was going to go to the pawn shop on my lunch break, sell the engagement ring and buy a gun from the same shop. 

After work I was going to just start driving, e-mail the suicide letter I already wrote and turn off my phone.

Then I was just going to drive, for as long as it took - either until I ran out of money or until I was really ready to pull the trigger. 

That morning I was still firm on just getting to the pawn shop and getting the process started, I knew it was what I wanted to do. Fuck this ring, fuck everything it ever meant - exchange it for a weapon to take my life away.

Then, I get to the pawn shop and I give them the ring. I'm looking at their pistols while they look it over. They come back, offer me $130. Hell, I knew I wasn't going to get much - I figured $500 and that would be fine - maybe even $400. I spent $2,500 so I figured at least $500 right? Wrong. I just walked out, I was so frustrated. Another hit, I would have thought this would have taken me over the edge....but for some reason it didn't.

I went home, filed my taxes that I've been putting off(extension expired that day and I owe money.) Finished work, had a couple of drinks, sat around. 

I guess it's not a great story, I just wanted to tell someone without freaking out any of my friends or family. It's strange how something so simple, something that normally would break my heart even further can just stop you dead in your tracks. 

I still feel empty, even more-so now that I got so close to what I wanted to do..but now I don't know what I'm going to do.

more than ever. I've had suicidal thoughts/been suicidal for about two years now. 9 months ago, I've had two attempts, and only one of them had any effect at all. I feel like I am selfless, yet I am egoistic. I get attached too easily and than the fact, that the -person im attached to- doesn't tell me ""you're my great friend"" and stuff like that makes me even more depressed. I have problems with trust..because, somewhere inside of me, I know(or..hope) that they probably really like me, but most of myself makes me feel like everyone is just faking the care about me so I don't annoy them that much. That's the reason why I left my girlfriend, I just felt like she doesn't love me. Now, I could probably come back to her, but that would be so shitty move after what I have done that I just can't do that to her. I just can't feel like someone likes me without they actually telling me the thing. I know, it's my fault. There's more things, that make me depressed. I used to be bullied. My mother was in prison(or..jail? The one that isn't ""that bad"", if that makes sense, sorry, not native english speaker) two times. I have dreams of becoming a musician, but, even with me learning how to play guitar and keyboards and learning to sing and writing lyrics..what are the odds, that it may be the thing that I'll be doing for a living? I wasn't built for this world. My grandpa thinks I am addicted to PC just because when there's some kind of celebration or somehting like that, I don't go out and talk with people. They(other members don't think I am addicted, but still, they just tell me ""why dont you go out with others"") just don't seem to get what it feels like when my hobbies aren't that usual(at least in the country and area I live in) and that I have terrible anxiety(or somehting like that, I don't have it confirmed or anything, but few times I've almost lost blacked out). I was to a psychologist. Once. I've lied to her, because I was afraid she'd tell mother(or my father, but they're divorced and I live with my mother, so i assume she'd tell her) about my suicidal tendencies and attempts. I am a big goddamned failure. Instead of doing school stuff(beside math, mother tongue and English I'm not really good at anything..I mean, yeah, I know stuff. But not stuff for school, for school doesn't care for my knowledge about Universe and stuff like that) I either play TF2, play guitar/keyboard, sing, try to write stuff(i have some kind of ""artistic depression"" if you know what that means) or listen to music. I usually have like one month of a really, really great mood and then month or two of ""depression"", emptiness, just feeling like I'm falling into the endless void. I know it may sound stupid. But I really like meme pages. Like, the ones on Facebook. I don't know how, but those which are making fun of depression and stuff like that..make me feel better. It may be a paradox or not. 

Well, to the point..last two weeks I just really feel like doing it. More than ever, beside these two attempts. I have a diary and a ""to-do list before I die"". There are also my unfinished suicide letters from before..usually I write them and then I just get so tired I fall asleep(I've lost the plot again..lol). I don't know..it just may be ""it""

256164,"Edating, cheating, blackmail, stalking and suicideMy life is pretty messed up and I‚Äôm pretty stupid. There‚Äôs a lot of stuff but I‚Äôll try to keep it as short as possible. 

Basically, when I was young (15) I started talking to this guy online (20). We ‚Äúedated‚Äù for 2 years, but I knew he was ‚Äúcheating‚Äù on me. By cheating I mean sending other women stuff. We were both virgins (as far as I knew). I wanted to meet up with him, but we lived really far away and my mother wouldn‚Äôt let me go and he didn‚Äôt want to travel to see me. I ended up giving him some money so he could come, but that didn‚Äôt work out. 

The relationship was painful (I knew he was cheating). I know it‚Äôs hard to say it‚Äôs cheating because it wasn‚Äôt a real relationship, but I really liked him and it hurt me really badly. Anyways, so me and that online guy broke up. Then I started seeing this guy that I worked with inrl. But I still missed the online guy. I messaged him and told him about my new bf and obviously the online guy didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me. This was a really painful experience and I‚Äôm not proud of it but I basically became the online guys stalker. 

So I was dating someone inrl and I was ‚Äústalking‚Äù this online guy. During this time I lived with my mother. However, she kept having psychotic breaks and we‚Äôd recently moved country so I had no friends or family to live with, so I ended up moving in with my inrl boyfriend. However, still I kept messaging this online ‚Äúex‚Äù but he practically begged me to stop messaging him. Then eventually he just stopped replying. Ignoring and being not replied to hurts me the most. It hurts me so much. 

Anyways, so during this time I had a couple online friends I‚Äôd talk to. I‚Äôve never been very social or been good with people. There was this one guy id had a rocky friendship with. So this guy and me didn‚Äôt like each other at all when we first met. Then we sort of became friends, but then he betrayed my trust. Then years later we became friends again. Then we started to get really close. He was one of the only people I felt I could be 100% honest with about my real life and all the things I‚Äôd done. 

Then me and this other guy started an ‚Äúonline relationship.‚Äù This guy knew I had a bf, as he‚Äôd followed my inrl social media‚Äôs for years. Then my inrl bf knew the online guy as like my best friend, my only friend really. So me and this guy started having a ‚Äúromantic‚Äù relationship for a few months. But he‚Äôd always get mad at me about having a inrl boyfriend. I tried to explain that I couldn‚Äôt leave because I lived here and stuff. I know it wasn‚Äôt right.

Then basically this guy snapped one day and decided to start blackmailing me for money or else he‚Äôd expose me. Because I lived with my boyfriends family that could mean I‚Äôd have no where to live. I‚Äôd already given this guy money as gifts and stuff. I really thought he was my friend too. But I ended up having to give him more to make him stop. This whole experience really messed me up even more. I‚Äôve always been really suicidal and depressed. I‚Äôm not saying that as some sort of excuse, I‚Äôm just saying that I didn‚Äôt really see many other options when I was being threatened. I came very close to just ending it to escape. I know it‚Äôs a situation I brought on myself, but it was still horrible. 

My inrl bf learned about all the stuff that had happened, and he was really mad and rude. But he eventually forgave me. 

Then because I‚Äôm a genius, a year later, after not talking to that online guy that threatened me, I decided to talk to him again. I messaged the guy that threatened me, and basically robbed me again. I think it was because part of me felt guilty? Because he always said he was cruel and did all that horrible stuff because of my inrl life. But I couldn‚Äôt really do much to change my inrl life? 

Anyways, so me and the threat guy start something up. All this ‚ÄúI‚Äôll love you forever, you‚Äôre my soulmate,‚Äù etc etc literally every cheesy thing you could imagine. Then obviously he ends up taking more of my money. Then he tells me he can‚Äôt deal with my inrl and that he‚Äôs going to expose me and ruin my life on my birthday. 

So now here I am. I know I did this to myself and I was stupid. I know I‚Äôm a horrible cheat. I tell myself these things everyday, believe me. So I don‚Äôt need you to judge me. 

I‚Äôve tried to get into contact with the threats guy but he just ignores me. I‚Äôve left so many messages, called so many times. My birthday is approaching soon and I‚Äôm just filled with dread, it makes me feel so sick and disgusting, and I find it hard to do anything. 

The inrl guy knew about the first time and how the online guy threatened me. I can‚Äôt bring myself to tell the inrl guy that I was stupid enough to message the threat guy again. I just can‚Äôt. Also, I feel like my inrl bf will flip out. He has a really bad temper sometimes and has grabbed me and pulled me around a couple of times. Only when he found out about the online stuff I did, so I know I deserved it anyways. But I‚Äôd have nowhere to live.

But I guess I used the online guy as some sort of escape from my painful life. But then the online guy just made my reality worse. It‚Äôs just the constant anxiety that something bad is going to happen is so tiring and upsetting. 

I know I dug myself into a hole. But the only way out seems like suicide. I‚Äôve seen a lot of therapists. I even told a therapist about when the online guy threatened me the first time. She basically judged me and said I was stupid. Then she told me to tell the police. But if a woman therapist judged me, imagine what some buff police officer would do, they‚Äôd just laugh at me. 

I know I‚Äôve done some horrible stuff. I do know that. But I was just in so much pain. I still am. I‚Äôm just writing this on here because there‚Äôs no one I can tell this all to. No one. I don‚Äôt really know what to do other than wait. I still keep thinking that threat guy will message me or something, but I know he doesn‚Äôt really care. 

The online guy I would chat to all day. But the inrl guy was inrl. Like I knew if I was broken the inrl guy would be there, you know? And I‚Äôm so easily broken. Whenever I‚Äôve made posts in the past all these strong people come at me like move out, stop being a leech etc. But I have no one. I have no family. No friends. Then sometimes I think if I lived completely alone, there‚Äôd be no one stop stop me from killing myself. Which my inrl bf has had to do in the past. 

I know the inrl guy gave me so much and did so much for me. I do feel horrible. I feel like I‚Äôm not good enough for him. He comes from a nice family, and compared to that I‚Äôm trash. Then the online guy I really liked so so much. I gave him so much (gifts, money, time). But he just threatens me and ignores me. I knew the online guy for years and years, and I thought we had a basic level of friendship. It wasn‚Äôt just some random guy....

I‚Äôm just in a lot of pain and I‚Äôm mentally messed up from what I‚Äôve done. So I just feel physically tired and sick all of the time. Then all I can do is wait. I just feel so powerless.

Sorry I just wrote this stupid essay, that I know literally no one cares about. All I am is pathetic, self pitying, weak and depressed. Well that‚Äôs what everyone tells me. Everyone also tells me I‚Äôm dead inside too, which I guess is true. 

Why couldn‚Äôt that first online guy love me and not cheat on me? 

Why couldn‚Äôt I have passionate feelings and deeply love the inrl guy? 

Why couldn‚Äôt the other online guy love me? And not threaten and blackmail me? 

TLDR; I edated this dude when I was young that repeatedly cheated on me for 2 years. Then I started dating someone inrl but still liked the online guy. The online guy didn‚Äôt like me. 

Then another online friend and me got together while I had a inrl bf (which the online guy knew about). 

However, the online guy couldn‚Äôt handle my inrl life so he repeatedly threatened me for money. This lead me to the point where I felt like suicide was the only escape (I‚Äôve been depressed for years). So now I live in fear that my life is going to be destroyed on my birthday.

86141,"My Story - I probably would never do it, but it's a thought in my mindNot sure where to start, so I'll begin with the basics. I'm a 19-year-old male, living in the UK; I left school at 16 and went to a college for 2 years, finishing at 18. From here I began searching for a job. I live in a very small area and so it was very difficult to land a job. After around 6 months of trying, I finally got one. It was a very good job for someone of my age and was one that I could potentially stay at for the rest of my life.

Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt cope with it. I have been an extremely quiet person for almost as long as I remember, all throughout school I was known as one of the quiet ones, and still now, to everyone that knows me, I am still, ‚Äúthe quiet one‚Äù. The job I got involved making a large amount of phone calls to people, whereby I would be asking them a lot of questions and answering a large amount of phone calls as well, where I would need to relay a lot of information back to answer the questions that they had for me. Being a quiet person, this was very difficult for me to handle and the added pressure of having co-workers in the office that could all hear me having to give out all this information, whilst they know me as ‚Äúthe quiet one‚Äù, made it just too much for me to be able to handle and I ended up resigning after around 3-4 months as it was making me ill and keeping me up all night worrying about having to go back through it all the next day.

Since this, I haven‚Äôt really made any progress towards anything. I have spoken to Doctors, Counselors etc, but as the issue I am having, is that I am extremely quiet, I don‚Äôt feel I am getting anything from it as I struggle to speak to people. This is probably going to sound completely ridiculous, but I struggle to speak to my own family. I rarely start a conversation with the people I am closest too and when they try and start the conversation up, I tend to give one word answers and the conversation stops there. As much as I would love to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and be able to have these social interactions with the people I am closest too, I cant and the thought of that makes me feel so stupid.

My mum is very ill right now and worrying her only makes things worse and causes her stress levels to escalate which causes her a lot of pain, even to the point were she in unable to get up.

I feel as though I am just a burden to my family as all this seems to cause issues and stress for everyone I am close too, as all they want is for me to get a job and live a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù happy life. I am not currently working which makes me feel even worse, but the fear of going back to a job and the whole cycle repeating itself is just too much.

Like I said in the title of this post, I probably would never do it, but it's a thought in my mind. To be honest, the reason I haven‚Äôt is because of the impact it would have on my mum, as she has asked me a number of times if I would ever do it and my response has always been no.

As I don‚Äôt seem to be going anywhere, or have any drive to improve things, I just don‚Äôt know what to do, I don‚Äôt want to be a shut in anymore, but I have know idea how to even start improving anything, just thought I write my ideas down as that tends to make me feel a little better.

326515,"why keep goingI no longer want to live.  I have been dealing with depression and crippling anxiety for almost 20 years.  And, I see no end in sight.  Therapy and drugs have done nothing.  I am tired of feeling like I am spinning out of control.  Things keep getting worse.  I am tried of my mind never stopping.  I am tired of not sleeping.  

I have pushed everyone in my life away.  Anytime I have a chance for a new relationship, I sabotage it somehow.  Usually due to my anxiety causing me to freak out.  When it isn't anxiety, it's the hate and rage and anger that I hide behind.

I am tired of being alone.  I am tired of screwing everything I do up.  I am tried of fighting and losing.  I am tired.  I have made a deal with myself to not do anything until after the holidays.  I have no plans to see my next birthday though.  I have a nice job, house, car.  I have maybe 3 good friends.  When I do this, I might hurt a dozen people.  But, I honestly don't know how many of them care.  I have told a few and they seemed to blow it off.  Why keep going.  I have no light in my life...no meaning or purpose.  I am running out of ideas.  I have tried finding happiness at the bottom of many bottles.  I have tried exercise to the point I am getting ready to run my 2nd marathon.  But, it all feels meaningless.

I don't know why i have waited this long...too scared to pull the trigger.  But, I see no way out.  I feel nothing anymore.  I think about this multiple times a day.  I am planning every detail of it.  I hope to not have my body found.  I am going to this.  I am to a point where I can openly tell people, and I don't care what they say.  I just want to be done with it.  People can tell something in me has changed.  Even my therapist is worried.  But, I don't care anymore.  I am tired of hiding behind a fake smile...fake happiness.  I almost walked out of my last session because it doesn't matter anymore.  I just don't care.

I am half expecting to get fired from my job any day, maybe tomorrow.  And, I don't care.  Just another reason to finally do this.  I just want to be happy, to be close to someone.  But, I have done nothing but fuck things up.  Time and time again.  To the point it feels scripted.  I can predict what will happen, it is just a matter of time.  I always fuck things up.  And, I always will.  I am tired of being fucked up in the head and that causing all of this.  And, no one understands.  Maybe, I am still hopefully for life.  Maybe that is why I am waiting.  Or, letting go to strangers on the internet.  But, every time I see a spark of hope, it's just the fuse to a bomb.  Something will blow up and take me even lower...somehow.

But, I have no faith in anything anymore.  I have nothing left to give.  I have given up.  I just can't fight anymore.  I just want to be done with all life.  Maybe this is my last goodbye.  I don't know.  I just want to go away and never be found.  I am tired...I am done.  I don't know what else to do.",suicide

107242,"[discussion] I haven‚Äôt seen nearly enough people talking about this, the trump administration finalized the removal of LGBT health protections. They first started the process to do this, not only during pride month, but on the anniversary of the Orlando massacre. It was finalized this Friday. 

Transgender health protections were made to be included with sex discrimination by the obama administration. Before then 1 in 5 trans people were rejected medical care just for being trans, and 28% dealt with harassment in medical settings. 

Now, Trump is reversing these changes that protected transgender people. This will make it legal once again for:

-Health care providers to refuse to help anyone they believe to have a sexuality or gender identity they don‚Äôt like.

-Health care companies to ban all transition related parts of health care (ex. hormone therapy)

-Hospitals to house transgender people with their birth sex, instead of the gender they identify as. 

-Health care providers to refuse HIV and STI prevention.

-Not recognize someone‚Äôs marriage to the same sex as valid. 

-(please let me know if i missed anything here) 


They can even discriminate if they‚Äôre receiving GOVERNMENT FUNDING. And don‚Äôt forget he also made it legal for homeless shelters to reject them, even though LGBT people are more likely to become homeless.

The worst thing about dreaming
Is knowing that these images 
Will never become real. 
I‚Äôll never go to these destinations 
That I create in my mind. 
I‚Äôll never meet the people
Who spring up from my brain. 
I can never touch, talk, see, hear
Them in this world. 
In these places of fiction
I am who I want to be
I do what I want to do. 
There are no restrictions
Within the mighty fortress
That is inside my head. 
It is amazing to be able 
To go anywhere I want.
I could fly or breathe underwater
I could swim through land
Or walk on the clouds. 
But not being able
To do any of these things 
Outside my mind

143485,"I love life, but I don't deserve it.I have squandered the many opportunities in life that I have had as an attractive white middle class male in the 1st world.  Because of my demographic, I believe any failure is completely my fault.  I have no great oppression to fight, and no story that deserves to be told.  

The only thing I hate about life is myself.  My carbon emissions and human waste are my only contributions to the world.  I want to kill myself and donate my organs and my place in life to someone deserving of my opportunities.  I hate myself for being so terrible at things.  I have a great work ethic... but that is easily surpassed by someone more deserving who has natural talent and doesn't need to pour their life force into their work just to reach the lower middle.

I've:
-Dropped out of music school
-Tried to learn Spanish for 9 years, yet still am not fluent
-Desperately hemmhoragged any extra spending money to save an emergency fund that can't seem to get above a pathetic 2k
-squandered social and life opportunities  in hopes of building a larger emergency fund (to no avail)
-consistently been dominated in my hobbies (chess, MTG, any videogame)

   My friends graduate college with half as much effort as I put in to failing.  I've seen people get better at spanish in 6 months than I have in 9 years.  
   I don't know anyone who can scrimp and save as much as I can but I certainly know people who never turn down a drink at the bar or a new expensive amenity for their house(which they own) who make LESS an hour than I do.
   Even hobbies, which I thought were an escape, offer me nothing but defeat despite my passion and effort towards learning them.

   I feel like Rudy, and I hate it.  I feel like a novelty story about the principle of work ethic for a real ""do-er"" to admire.  ""Wow, look at how hard he struggles to get nothing...""  Like my point in life is to die in vain so better people can be impressed by my effort and not my accomplishments.",suicide

Its so overwhelming and like I actually almost tried these three weeks. Like i actually almost took the bottles of pills out of my house to bring with me. Or I tried to hang myself. I had the pills in my hands. I don't know I feel like I cant even fcking escape this feeling I feel so messed up everything that happened to me I don't want to feel like this anymore I hate feeling so miserable or sad. I don't enjoy life anymore at all and I feel hopeless. I always think down on myself and put my own self down and I feel like none of my siblings or friends wanna be by me, I feel like a bother. The only time I ever feel abit of enjoyment or happiness and stress free is when I smoke weed but it only lasts like a hour or so and then i just feel the exact same feeling as I did before. I know this is so much but I can never tell anybody like my family how i feel its so scary and I feel I'm just bothering people with my problems I'm only a 15 year old girl should i be having the best teen years were i can feel good about my self and hangout and talk to all my friends. Not staying in my room crying for hours being to unmotivated to shower or brush my hair.

281456,"What is the point of living? I just want all the pain to go away. I mean who will notice when I'm gone anyways?Okay well I'm new to Reddit so I don't know how to really start but I guess I'll try by explaining my various issues...


The number one issue for my depression is that I hate myself, so in other words, my low self-esteem. I look in the mirror and see the reflection and I'm just disgusted. I'm ugly, fat, stupid, and their is no one who could ever like a person like me.


I've cut for the past four years of my life off and on. It has gotten significantly worse these past two years though. I used to cut maybe once of twice a week, and now its almost everyday.


I think about killing myself everyday. Every morning when I wake-up, if something bad happens during the day, and before I go to bed. Before I fall asleep at night I pray that I won't wake-up in the morning. That all the pain and all the suffering will be over, and I'll be gone. The people in my life will move on and act as if I was never here. No one will care, and everyone's lives will be a lot easier. My parents, my few friends(if you can even call them that), and my boyfriend. I've had multiple attempts aswell. Planned it all out, left suicide notes, ready to do it, but well as you can see, unfortunately I'm still alive.


My number two reason is my mother...

She blames me for ALL the stress in her life... She blames me for things that happen at her office, like if one of her employee's fuck up she'll compare me to them and say that I'm just like them! She calls me stupid, lazy, worthless and that I'll never amount to anything in life. If she doesn't like the clothes that I'm wearing she'll tell me I look like a prostitute... She blames me for her having diabetes(like I'm sorry I fucking shoved sugar down your throat....?!)


The number three reason is that my parents put a lot of restrictions on me. I'm 18 and I'm not allowed to go anywhere. Even if I want to go see a movie or go for coffee with one of my friends I have to ask for permission, which is pointless because they always say no anyways.

I get no independence. I get no life. They suffocate me. I HAVE to work in their office; I am not allowed to get any other job. This is so they can keep an eye on me, and see what I am doing at all times. I am not allowed to take my cell phone to work or keep it in my room when I get home. I forgot to mention that I pay for this phone myself.


My number four reason is my boyfriend. This is also a huge contributor to my issues. I care and love him a lot so don't get me wrong or anything, but I just feel like I'm always doing something wrong in our relationship, or I'm stressing him out with all my ""drama"". I just feel like he wants to break-up with me. He constantly tells me that this is not the case and that he does not want a break-up. I just feel like he deserves someone better than me. Someone who's smarter, prettier, and will give him everything he wants/needs in a relationship.

Then theirs the whole thing where he has this close friend who's a girl whom he hangs out with quite a bit and it just really pisses me off. Yes, I understand he needs his friends and that you can have friends of the opposite sex without being attracted to them. I mean all of my friends are guys so I'm really not trying to be a hypocrite here. Its just that he makes me feel like she's more important than me. It feels like he chooses her over me. When she's around its like I don't even exist. He will totally ignore me, and he even puts me down in front of her... It hurts a lot when he does this. Its just like what's the point of even being in a relationship if your going to make me feel bad about myself? :'(

I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. I don't know where I'm going or what is going to happen to me. I'm really scared...

At night I just sit out on my roof and imagine jumping off. How easy it would be. How all the pain would go away... Just end it all.",suicide

So far, some days have been harder than others, today I could not get out of bed per usual and skipped two classes. As I made my way to my third class, I got an increasingly amount of death stares (or so it seemed) from complete strangers (how lovely). Or maybe I'm letting my anxiety get the best of me?? Afterwards, I went to eat some really delicious pho (getting out of this sad place tends to be the highlight of my day). Eventually, I went back to my apartment to nap and woke up to the usual lonely darkness (feels like the physical embodiment of abandonment).  Lately I have been ignoring my mother's calls, which is terrible in itself, but it has been hard listening to her voice let alone speaking to her. On the contrary, listening to the Smiths has been very easy.  

I do not have any major assignments due soon (as in tomorrow) so I need to find ways to keep myself busy tonight even though I should start studying for finals. So here I find myself. 

I don't really cry anymore. Just when I realize how deep I have gone and how bad this has become. I guess I am trying to say this is getting far too familiar for me. People blankly stare at me? I should kill myself tonight. I feel ignored in class? Maybe I should not bother anymore. I let others cut me at the bus stop? What the hell am I doing.

The world is moving, but I have been abandoned. 
Everyone is making new friends and trying new places. And I am here. Alone in my room. 

No one is going to really save me, no one wants to save me.

Additional Incoherent Nonsense:
Fuck it, everyone deserves some fckn sympathy. No one deserves this bullshit. No one deserves walking around with so much weight. I just want to walk around ignorantly happy and enjoy it. Nothing more. Someone get me out of here. I don't want this anymore.

164774,"I have been feeling worthlessAnd it's consuming me. It's like I cant even go 30 minutes without dwelling on everything wrong with me.
I try to distract my mind and focus on other things but then I spiral back into thinking about how I just want to not exist anymore. I wanna evaporate, disappear.

Even fun things feel like a chore and it's hard to be motivated to do anything. I dread having to go to work, to do school work, to do anything. On my days off I should feel relaxed but I can't because I'm still worrying about all the things that need to be done.

I'm constantly counting the time, whether it's how much time I have left in work, how much time is left in the day before I need to sleep, how much time I have before an assignment is due. I feel anxious all the time.

I feel unlovable, stupid, ugly, and honestly I don't think that feelings will go away even if someone tries to tell me it's not true. Even if they don't think so, I still think I am and they just haven't noticed yet.

And that's not really fair to anyone to have them be my only source of happiness, and I don't know if I could handle it again, to get my Hope's up thinking someone loves me only to have them eventually leave.

264273,"I dont know why I botherI'm 22 now and ever since I was 16 probably I came to the realization that I was worthless. That was about the time I came out of my shell at school and started to be a little more confident. Turns out that people hated that part of me. Apparently what I thought was me coming out of my shell was apparently me just being an ""annoying little shit"". I had one really good friend in high school that I probably will really miss a whole lot because he is actually the best. But most of the people I hung out with made my life hell. Every recess/lunch every time I'd speak up I was told to shut up telling and given this stupid nickname which was ""so funny"". They called me ""turdtool"" which was such a great play on words because it sounded like turtle. I probably brought it on myself. I don't know I thought I was fine but I guess if everyone thought it was the case then I must just really be a little shit. It got worse whenever Harri went away for basketball or was sick that day. Harri was always the one person who was never mean to me even though I probably annoy him to. Whenever he wasn't there to back me up my ""friends"" would dump water on me or knock me around a lot as well as the constant insults. 

Family life wasn't a huge amount better. I have 7 siblings and it always seems like I am the one getting into fights and causing problems. It didn't matter who it was I'd probably fought a lot with them. Basically my family all thinks I am an immature troublemaker which gives me even more reason to think it would be better if I was gone.

 The best part of my life used to be work. I was happy at my casual job at KFC. I worked hard and I stayed quiet mostly. I even ended up being so good at my job that the store manager personally requested I became a manager (What a ""great"" achievement) but since the I have moved towns for uni and started at a new store. I don't really fit in here and I found out the other day was that I am one of the least favorite managers here because I am ""not fun at all"". 

I have no ""real"" friends in Newcastle. I still keep in touch with Harri but he is 500km away and we basically only talk when playing games. I thought I did but one of the people I thought was a good friend was talking to me the other day and told me that he wouldn't say that I am a ""friend friend"" and more just someone he plays games with.

One if the only reasons I am still here is Harri. Every day I think I annoy him more and more and I am just waiting for the time when he gets sick of me and wants to break off our friendship. I want to tell him all of this but I don't want to be a burden to him because he is great but super busy. He has a full time job and uni to deal with and that can't be easy for him. 

People always say that suicide is selfish because you are leaving so many people behind and they will all miss you. I doubt many people would miss me. My parents and siblings probably and then Harri. That's why I can't but it's so hard my parents are super critical of things I do and I just want to tell them to ease up a bit but they say they just want the best for me. I just don't want to keep fighting and I want it all to end.

209049,"When your best option isn't an optionMaybe this isn't the place for this. I don't know anymore. I dedicated five years of my life to being an EMT in some misguided attempt to redeem myself. Before that I was all kinds of things. I did well in military school. I'm an Ivy League dropout. I was a drug dealer, and a prostitute, and a caregiver for autistic children, and a drug addict, and a devoted step parent to special needs children, and a foster mom for stray animals, and just about everything else you can imagine. I was 300 lbs. I lost 150 lbs. I'm a popular bartender now and I make a great living. But I'm in freefall. I've run out of road. I'm waking up screaming every morning, when I'm lucky enough to sleep, remembering fucking on webcam when I was twelve, or beating up a lifelong friend over a drug debt, or trying to tell someone, somehow, that there was nothing I could do to save their baby after a rough delivery. My entire life, I've sought out every extreme I could think of to make myself feel... something. And now I feel everything. I couldn't possibly do to my family and friends what I've seen suicide do to those who survive it. But I want out. I resent my loved ones for refusing to release me. I don't know what to do with myself. Life is impermanent and meaningless, and the freedom to fail keeps a lot of us ok with ourselves. We hold on for others, or for the hope of a better day, or whatever bullshit we feed ourselves. But what about when you're suffering so much that you just want to say FUCK YOU I TRIED. Why can't they be the ones to get over it? Bad things happen all of the time. Why do I have to keep doing this, just so YOU feel better? Does anybody out there realize that all it takes is one careless person in traffic, one poorly chewed bite of food, one venture into the wrong place at the wrong time to render all of your fighting this impulse to be all for nothing? And then it wasn't even on your own terms.  I'm trapped by their weakness and all I'm doing is hurting myself worse and worse every day just so they don't even have to even get a taste of the suffering I've witnessed, absorbed, or lived day to day. The thing is, though, that whether you make it or not, they will face comparable adversity. When is enough enough? When is the unthinkable permissable? I won't do it. But I'm asking all of you who come here, why do you still keep going? Is it for you, or is it for them, or is it just your base nature to survive, whatever the cost? 

My point is this. I'm not still here for any good fucking reason other than to try to not contribute any more to the unavoidable suffering of others. I can't save anyone from anything. This isn't a pep talk. If your suffering is so great, so intractable, that you can't keep going... well shit. I guess you did something you were always going to, which is to die. You're doomed from the moment you're born. But if you're still fighting, then you sure as shit has better know why you're doing it. I've seen first hand how people suffer, and how they get over it. So it isn't for them... and it sucks for you, so it isn't for you...so what else is there? A moral obligation to observe an instinct that every worm, every weed has to survive? That isn't present in you.  So what is your reason? Because I have no fucking idea, and yet, here I am. I'm not going anywhere. ",suicide

24246,"Too sensitive and overthinkingActually this is the last instance that came to my thoughts, where I could let go of my feelings and ease my completely scattered and messed up mind. I have to keep things short and focus on what bothers me the most... hopefully I can achieve that. 
My life's been a mess ever since I can think... things just wouldn't go normal and it wasn't just  occasionally that I imagined how death could be the only salvation for me. Somehow.. I always felt too much. I felt like dieing whenever I was yelled at, beaten, lied to, deserted, left alone..although my life has taught me many lessons that should have thickened my skin. Fortunately, these weren't all good for nothing, some of them actually saved me. Still, this time I can't rely on any of the lessons from the last 22 years. 
To get more precise about my situation:
- I suffer from chronic nausea, dizziness and headaches, especially in the evening and morning (all in all since 2 years now) and nothing is helping against that
- I left my family and friends for my now ex boyfriend with whom I had been together for 3 years before moving to him 300km far away
- well, as mentioned already I left the first person I ever fell in love with and who supported me for 5 years in total with all the struggles I encountered ... looking back I am forgetting the reasons why I even left him - shattered and unable to do anything to change my mind
- I'm taking an apprenticeship (1 more year to finish it) and I hate the person that it made out of me and I can barely live without financial worries from my salary
- thus, I depend on the support of my parents, I hate nothing more than being dependant from somebody..I can't even give them back something besides tears they're crying for me because I'm giving up on myself 
- I completely fail at finding people who I can sympathize with...people that make me smile rather than cry
- the last and most painful reason: I fell in love again - with a person who is heaven and hell for me ...I love him so deeply for he has comforted me and made me smile after the break-up with my ex.. he listened to my worries and motivated me to live on
- we eventually came together pretty fast because we were yearning so much for each other (a hard act in itself because we were both fresh singles and somewhats not prepared for a new relationship) ..though we managed it somehow, on the top being in a far distance relationship and seeing each other approx. every 2 weekends
- the hell part: sometimes he is cold-hearted and saying things that completely obscure my actually warm and happy mindset..sometimes he is abusing me and treating me like garbage..still I love him, his warmth and smile ;
no matter how he treats me, I can't bear the thought to hurt someone again by leaving him
I promised my ex who happened to be my soulmate for all this time to never hurt someone again like I did with him
..so I'm sitting here waiting for hell to end itself and for losing heaven, too, the last glance of hope I have.. 
- and then there's my curse to feel too many things and to intensely...I get down over every single small punch that hits me

My thoughts for the last few weeks only circle around death. And there's no one I can trust...no one who wants to understand my crippled mind. Now I'm here.. probably missed out  bunch of side information or even a common thread.
What I want...or at least what I think that I want is a new thought to fill my mind with and get rid of 'death' and 'self-hatred'.

234806,"I got some perspective yesterdayStory time- 

At the start of the year I got approached by someone in the company I work for about a job he wanted me to apply to. Feeling like it would be a good opportunity to help my career I took the job. I started in April, a week later my baby was born 3 weeks early. I knew I wasn‚Äôt super comfortable with the job yet but I wanted to take the company paid 2 weeks parental leave to spend time with my new son. I called my boss to basically see if he was ok with it and he told me I wasn‚Äôt getting caught up fast enough (after a week) and that I couldn‚Äôt afford to take 2 weeks off yet. Off to a shitty start feeling like I suck at my job already and not able to spend time helping my wife with our child stress built up super fast. 

I started getting anxiety on Sunday nights, I didn‚Äôt want to go to be because I dreaded the thought of waking up to go to work. I hated the job because week after week my boss reminded me how bad I was at the job. A month or 2 in this built up to an all time high. I woke up in a sweat at 4:30 one morning, and was not in a good place. I couldn‚Äôt fall back to sleep, then it came. The darkness crept in, the idea of suicide. This was the first time in my life that the thought came and didn‚Äôt sound like a bad option. It scared me. 

The very next day I called my doctor. When I went in I didn‚Äôt say I was having suicidal thoughts... idk why. I explained all the other weird symptoms I had started experiencing for the recent months. He put me on an anti-depressant, the first few weeks were a rough adjustment with the added negative side effects of the medication. 

One day while I was feeling particularly down again I took my 2 year old to the park and we were running around playing, I pulled up my phone and started playing the trolls soundtrack since he‚Äôs obsessed with poppy. The song ‚ÄúGet Back Up Again‚Äù hit me. It has become the song I listen to when I‚Äôm feeling down. I think of the pure joy on my boys face when we were playing at the park and I hold that in my mind. The demons come, and I jam out to Poppy singing and think about my kids happiness. 

I decided the job was likely one of the biggest changes in my life that could be inviting the demons, so I started looking for a new job. I finally got an offer, I don‚Äôt start until mid October but I‚Äôm hopeful that the stress, and the darkness will go away. 

Yesterday I took my boys to my parents house and was talking with them for a little while. I told them about some of the stress of the job (not the extent of suicidal thoughts or anything) but my father told me he once worked with someone who did the same role but in his company. Supposedly about 1-2 months into the role this person went missing. They later found out he had committed suicide. That hit very close to home... that could‚Äôve been me. I thought I was just being dramatic about how bad the job is but someone else may have had the same dance with the darkness and lost. It shook me. I haven‚Äôt told anyone about my suicidal thoughts. This is the first time. 

I‚Äôve been talking to my doctor, my therapist, I‚Äôm changing my job... I‚Äôm hoping to get out of this soon. I want my life to be full of happiness, I want to see my boys grow up and build lives of their own. I want to be there for them. 

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm really saying this here. I guess I needed to say something to someone. I could use a hug. I guess I want someone to tell me that everything will be alright, that I‚Äôll make it through and to keep my head up.

I can't really talk to my friends about this because they don't know him that much and a few refuse to talk to him since he is dating me. :( So, here I am on reddit.

He sent a few things, I won't name them all. A few items were socks, a dog plush, a ton of Pusheen stickers which each had their own individual note, and a letter. He also sent me the only Pride gear I own (he is trans, I am female)!

I feel really happy. He is so kind! :)

I hope that everyone else here finds someone they can have a nice relationship with! Relationships come pretty randomly, but being a part of society helps a lot. I am introverted myself and connected with him thorough similar interests and Discord, so that's a great way to find nice people!

I wish I could do something in return, but it costs an insane amount of money to ship to his country (as he said, ""it costs as much as Starbucks"" to send stuff to me) and only documents are allowed. It is a post-USSR country and this mail system totally shows it. I decided that I will just do nice things for him on Minecraft! I've made him a few skins and a parrot-room, so I will do more things like that!

Oh, now I realize that he might be trying to repay me since I got him Minecraft as a gift a few weeks ago. He said that he was planning on sending me this in December, but his schoolwork has been harsh since. I guess Minecraft prompted this. Awww, this is so nice!

216023,"Made two attempts in the last week, long backstorySigh...Here it goes I guess. It is long but fuck it.
Backstory: My girlfriend and I have been dating for 5 years and living together for 4.5 years.

Back in November 2016 my girlfriend had an event in Florida. She was only there for something like 18 hours before she came back. After the event she started messaging one of the guys she met at the event on facebook. On christmas eve he called her and they talked on the phone for 2 hours (I was at my parents house). Afterwards she messaged him that she was feeling confused about her feelings. This was a man she had met 1 time and knew almost exclusively through facebook messages.

In February 2017 I saw their messages for the first time (I knew she talked to him but trusted her enough to never question it) and saw that he said things like ""I love you"" and such. She never responded to his advances and just ignored them. I told her it made me feel uncomfortable and I didn't want her talking to him anymore. She told me that I can't control her and she will be friends with whoever she wants. I acknowledged that she and I couldn't force her to stop talking to him but that it made me uncomfortable and hurt me knowing that she would keep talking to him. I also start to notice her being more distant and getting angry at me more often.

Fast forward to June and we were at an event together and she texted him ""I know if I see you again I won't be able to control myself and will do something I will not regret but I will regret that I won't regret it"" (I found out about this message recently). I also notice that she has grown very distant and begin to seriously worry around this time.

So in July she says she has an event in Tennessee and keeps changing the story about what kind of event but I chalk it up to me having bad memory. So the end of July comes around and I drive her to the airport for her event. She doesn't really text me the whole time because the people at the event ""don't allow her to use her phone"" and ""it is underground"" and ""I signed an NDA"". Well I know now from looking at her location (FindFriends) and some puzzle solving that she was at that guys house the entire time. She basically lied and set up a 5 day vacation to have cheat on me.

She gets back from the trip I notice she is extremely distant. She basically is always on her phone, she sits on the other side of the couch, she pushes me away when I try to show affection. So after a week or so I can't contain it anymore and I finally grab her phone while she sleeps and look at it...

I see her telling this due she loves him and even sending him lewd photos and talking about ""what if"" for abortions and such. I am destroyed. I confront her and at first she lies and says they didn't do anything yet. Then she admits to kissing him, and then finally admits that they had sex. She lies and says after the event they got a hotel (remember I later found out there was no event and she was at his house the whole time).

Then I notice she has plans to see him in another city for an event in mid August. I tell her if she goes we are done, etc... She says she doesn't want to lose me but she is going to ""tell him they have to be just friends"". I also notice she plans on staying at his hotel for the event. I tell her I will get her her own room and so she tells me she won't go. Then the event comes up and she packs her bags and goes.

A few days after the event I give up and ask her to at least stop talking to him so that I don't have to be crushed daily while we finish our lease together (ended in october). So just for a little over 1 month. She agrees to stop talking to him for that month. The next fucking morning I wake up to her closing the bedroom door (we don't have central AC so if you close the bedroom door it gets very hot in there). So I get up to open the door and ask why she closed it to find that she is playing PS4 with him.... Not even 6 hours after she agreed to stop talking to him while we lived out our last month together. She couldn't even wait until I went to work.

So I lost it. This completely broke me. I tried to go to the bathroom to kill myself and she tried to stop me. So sat on her on the bed and tried to kill myself so she couldn't stop me. The knife wouldn't cut deep enough so I gave up and collapsed in tears. After crying for a while I went to the bathroom to wash my face when the police knocked on the door. I heard them yell ""Come out slowly with your hands in the air"". 4 cops with guns drawn grabbed me and put me in cuffs. They questioned us in separate rooms and I denied wanted to kill myself. The police told me that I had 15 minutes to pack a bag and leave and that if I ever came back I would be arrested. I am the one that pays all the bills/rent and we are both on the lease but they didn't care.
After a few days a good friend of mine talked to my GF and convinced her to let me come back to the house to stay (I had nowhere else in the city to go). 

Things were okay for a little bit but in the beginning of september there was an event in our city and she went to stay ""at a friends hotel"". We had planned just days before to go to the event together to try to get along better for our final month. Turns out he came into town and she stayed with him and had sex with him just 1 block from our house.

I again forgave her and she finally agreed (and appeared to) stop talking to him for 7 days. Those days were nice but as soon as they were up she was blatantly talking to him again. She then moved out to her moms house in another city and I got my own place. Now I still talk to her and all but she avoids actually seeing me in person.

I know I should dump her and move on but I just can't. I gave her 25% of my time on this earth and I love her so damn much. I can't get her out of my head no matter how hard I try. Drugs, alcohol, friends, nothing gets her out of my head. She is always on my mind and I even dream about her. She is a prison I can't escape.

I tried to hang myself a week ago but the knot didn't hold and I feel and now my throat hurts like hell. I was close, even after the rope fell I blacked out. I tried again last night with xanax and alcohol but again that failed. Everything I planned for the future is ruined. She continues to lie to me everyday (we still text). She came and saw me last weekend because she needed a place to stay for an event but now that is over she refuses to see me anymore. I keep asking her to just be honest so I can actually understand it all but she continues to lie and lie.

My friends all left to another country or city for school/work and so I have nobody left. I tried to hang out with an old work friend but he ditched me. I have nobody left anymore. She meant the world to me and now she is gone. I know she doesn't love me anymore and I need to move on but I can't see a future without her.

I am so lonely and sad and feel so hopeless. I don't know what my purpose in life is anymore. Before she gave life meaning. To grow old with her, have a family with her, accomplish our dreams together. Now I am in the best position of my life (new well paying job, graduated college) but I am more sad than I have ever been. People keep telling me to move on and that I will find someone new but I was never good at making friends, let alone meeting women. Before her I had a few casual things but nothing serious and was content with being forever alone. Now I know that I will not find anyone else. I am weird, ugly, an asshole, I just... I have no hope

TLDR; My girlfriend of 5 years cheated on me and left me and now I don't know what to do or where to turn. I feel hopeless and worthless and just want to die.",suicide

283911,"Went home early from work today and am having bad thoughtsThis is probably going to be a long one but I think I just need to let it out. I guess to begin with I've had a history of depression but I've been off my antidepressants for about a year now. When I first started on them almost 2 years ago I still wound up in the bathroom about ready to slit my wrists with a knife. My best friend called and I answered and she was able to talk me out of it. The next day I checked myself into a behavioral health hospital. I spent a little over a week there. I returned to work and all was fine for about another 2 weeks. I had a seizure that seemed to have come out of nowhere. For the previous 6 months I had a problem with auditory and visual hallucinations (the doctor chalked it up to be from my depression). I saw my doctor the next day and immediately had me go get an MRI of my head done. That's when we found that I had a golf ball sized arachnoid cyst in my brain. From there everything snowballed. I only lasted a month before I had to go on medical leave at work. Seizure after seizure (even on antiseizure meds), a plethora of neurological issues; such as convulsions, dry heaving for hours, hallucinations getting worse. My right leg one day become completely paralyzed and once the feeling came back I could no longer walk on my own, I had to use a cane. I went through several neurologists either telling me I had epilepsy, or that it was all in my head. After 5 months of this I was finally able to get a neurosurgeon to perform the surgery to drain the cyst. It took about 6 months after the surgery (about this same time last year) to finally feel normal. My doctor was certain that the cyst had caused my depression and I felt comfortable to get off the meds, ALL of my meds. And I was fine. 

January of this year I got the okay to start working again. I didn't like my job that I had left to go on medical leave so I decided to get a new one. It took me about 2 months to find the job I am at now. It's not great, but has been okay enough. I liked it for the first couple months until this lady (K) on my team decided that she doesn't have to do anything. We get a bonus based on how many ""tasks"" we do in our queue, but have a ton of other things we have to that don't count towards our ""tasks"". You can probably see the issue here. K only does the tasks and leaves the rest up to me and whoever else is on our team (we've had a lot of turnover because of this). I've talked to my managers about K multiple times, every time someone requests to be transferred to a different department it's all the same reasoning. But she's been here for 3 years and her production numbers makes them ""look good"" (That's the only reason me and a lot of the other people in our office think of as to why they would hold onto her). Three months ago we got a new (well another new since we've been though about 4 at this point) girl (L) and we immediately hit it off. I was in charge of training L and she was doing great. We both get our work done and don't obsess over production. We had an issue with K for all the same reasonings so they decided to once again hire a new person and split the team. Me and L, and K with the newest addition (S). It had been working out.

Well, 3 weeks ago I had a seizure at work. I've known for a while something hasn't been right but I've been too afraid to say anything. I haven't had the crippling depression, but I've had more frequent headaches, the vision and auditory hallucinations, the random dizzy spells and nausea. I hid this from everyone, and I was probably kidding myself thinking this may just be from the aftermath of having had brain surgery last year. I knew something was up but didn't want to face it in fear of the worst, that the cyst came back. I just didn't want to know until I couldn't be ignorant anymore. So, until I had the seizure. Went to my doctor the next day, this time I was still suffering from severe postictal symptoms and they sent me straight to the ER to get a CT scan done. The hospital lied to me about my results, said that everything looked normal, and sent me home with some antiseizure meds and said to follow up with a neurologist. 

My primary care doctor had me come in a week later, I hadn't gone to work since I was having bad side effects from the antiseizure meds. He told me that the CT scan report does say that I have fluid built up in my brain in the same spot my cyst was. We can't classify it as a cyst yet since that's all the report said, I still have to get the MRI done.

My doctor wrote me a note and said I could go back to work the following Monday. I've almost made it two weeks back to work and have had to call out twice and leave to go home early a couple times from not feeling well. I've had 3 more seizures, been living on pain meds since my excruciating headache just doesn't seem to go away. My manager has been understanding and very adamant about me not getting stressed out over work and that my health should come first. 

Which brings me to today. They sent out an email saying they are moving L to a different department. Which means our team won't be separated anymore, and I will have to pick up after K's unending slack. At least L made working bearable, especially these past couple weeks. I don't even know if I'll have the stamina to deal with K. I can hardly concentrate on what I'm doing. I would put in my two weeks but I need the health insurance and obvisouly need to pay my bills. I know very well that my managers aren't going to do anything about K. I'm going to be stuck doing the majority of the work while she makes her bonus. All the stress over this triggered an episode and I wound up having to leave early and go home. I just don't want to deal with this. My head hurts, my body is shaking. I don't want to go on medical leave because I need the money and I used the majority of my PTO for that week I took off. How am I supposed to live? Pay bills? I was lucky enough to have my stepdad basically pay for everything last time I was sick since disability hardly pays anything. I just feel stuck. It was almost enough dealing with the office drama when I was okay but now I feel awful and can barely make it out of bed in the morning. What the hell am I supposed to do? I just feel like I'm screwed no matter what. It's like yeah sure I could might be able tough it out for another excruciating 6 months but I really don't want to. I've been through watching my body fall apart and what this stupid thing in my head does to me. I just don't want to deal with this anymore. 

Anyways, thank you for reading if you've made it this far. I probably just needed to let it out or something. ",suicide
122403,"Why Is Life HellI wish I could tell you when the last time I felt well was. We are speaking mentally and physically. I cannot possibly pinpoint the cause behind these two things which have brought a drastic change to my life. I am an absolute idiot. My anxiety, anger, depression, and numbness has taken me over. My anxiety causes me to be too anxious to eat because I fear being sick. My anxiety caused me to become a shut in. I am not ashamed of becoming a shut in. My anger has caused me to lash out onto loved ones, hurt myself, and almost damage my belongings. My depression just simply holds me back from living like a normal human being. I won‚Äôt shower for a week, I won‚Äôt get out of bed, I won‚Äôt talk to people, and I will constantly be exhausted. My numbness causes somewhat of a mixture of all of these things. It causes me to want to break something because I just want to feel. It makes me yearn to let a few tears out just to reassure myself that I haven‚Äôt given up on myself. It makes me anxious because I don‚Äôt know if I will randomly have a panic attack. 
Physically I am suffering as well. It seems impossible to gain weight. I am constantly feeling as if I will drown in the mucus that is in my throat. When I breathe in, my breath doesn‚Äôt even reach near my throat. I catch myself gasping and wheezing for air. There‚Äôs not a week that goes by where I don‚Äôt feel any sort of pain in my stomach. There‚Äôs not a week that goes by where I have a strange bowel movement. There‚Äôs not a day that goes by where my throat tickles yet feels as if it is being scratched at the same time which causes me to cough lightly. 
I seem to learn something new everything. They are things that I was supposed to already know. Did you know that the 7 in 24/7 stands for how many days there are in a week? There are seven days in a week and I only figured out the meaning behind that 7 in 24/7 a week ago. There are so many things that I should know by now yet I simply don‚Äôt. It seems impossible to do basic math. Adding, subtracting, multiplying, counting, and measurements are all that I am good at. There is a huge portion that I have always failed, even when I thought I had done phenomenal. 
When there is a loud sound it feels like I can‚Äôt hear and my gag reflex feels as if it has been set off. Of course, I don‚Äôt really gag. I just can feel something in my throat having a spasm when there is a loud sound such as the washer, dryer, or a family member speaking very close to me. My family is loud and does not have an inside voice. 
The only thing that I enjoy doing would be writing. All of my other old hobbies are out of the picture. Working out? I haven‚Äôt done that in a long time. Coloring? I do that sometimes but I can only handle doing it on my iPad. I can‚Äôt do it on a literal piece of paper. It makes me upset when the color gets out of the line or when I don‚Äôt draw in a straight line. There are many other hobbies which I used to participate in, but I no longer am able to.
I hate it when the light is too bright and flashing lights. I have to close my eyes and sometimes it sends me off into a panic. It makes me want to scream, cry, and throw something at it to make it stop. When there are loud sounds all I want to do is hide. Where I am around too many people it makes me want to run and hide. 
A few days ago my doctor ordered a blood test and an EKG. There is no response on the blood test but the EKG was normal. He then proceeded to force me to see a psychiatrist because he assumes that I have an eating disorder. This man does not understand that i truly do love to eat. I am just scared of what the food will do to my body. He poked me and squeezed me and kept telling me how skinny I was. 
I don‚Äôt know what is wrong with me but I really want to know. I need to help myself and I need to become normal again. If I don‚Äôt become normal again then how will I ever have a family one day? If I were to have children how would I raise them when it‚Äôs difficult to take care of myself? Who would love somebody who is so screwed up? I just want to be good and healthy again. I wish that I didn‚Äôt have to worry about how I was going to feel during the day or night. My life has become pure hell and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it. ",suicide

261773,"Anthony's story.I'm 17, male. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I can't seem to care about anything. I don't care that I would destroy my mother if I killed myself. I would be gone anyways. I've never had a girlfriend, I'm so lonely to the point where my chest is always hurting. I really didn't think I could physically or mentally hurt this bad. Parents split when I was young, maybe 7 or 8. Didn't grow up with any brothers, only 6 other sisters all significantly older than me. I wasn't wanted, my mother took cough medication while on the pill. She married a man she apparently didn't get to know enough, because when she married him, he changed completely. He became emotionally and potentially physically abusive. I don't know if he physically abused her. She always wanted me to like him, she never told me what really happened. She just wanted me to be happy, and have a family. She dealt with the abuse for years and years. When they divorced, I didn't understand the magnitide of what happened, I was a young kid still. But I knew enough to know they didn't love eachother anymore. I only have one memory from my childhood in that house, with my parents together: 2 of my sisters and I sitting in my room while my parents fought. I remember telling them I was hungry, and being told we had to stay inside the room for now. I wondered why mom and dad had to fight all the time. 

After the divorce, mother got main custody. We were poor alot. I don't remember too well, but I do remember being hungry, and there just being a box of crackers in the cabinet. I don't know if my father paid child support.

School wasn't an escape, I was severely bullied there. With no real guidance about what to do, and teachers who quite literally *watched* while I was beat, I just took it. 
 I was living with my mother mainly, I'm glad she got custody. She had to work full time day and night to afford rent and food. I was home alone alot. I remember crying whenever I had to go to my fathers house, lying on the floor sobbing and having my mother just try to reason with me. She just wanted a happy family, she tried so fucking hard. She tried so hard to make things right, she sacrificed SO much. She truly gave it her all, 110% the whole way.
I don't blame her for anything.
 
I had a few friends at school, but for all but one of my school years, I was severely bullied. From about 4th grade and up I dealt with it. It got violent when I was age 9 or 10. I remember just wanting a group of friends on the playground. Just didn't wanna get hit anymore. Didn't wanna be scared and have to run. I went through all of school like this until 2nd year of highschool. One day I wouldn't go out the door. I refused. She homeschooled me from then on. So I learned *nothing* in the way of social skills or the other million things you needed to learn from growing up with friends and kids around you. I never even had a chance to have a relationship. I did have a girlfreind when I was maybe 15. Didn't last long, we broke up and we never even kissed. Developed severe trust issues and eventually full on paranoia. Time passes and I become really depressed. I don't know whats happening at this point. I have a hard time remembering things. Severe social anxiety.. Mom tried to help with putting me in boyscouts my first year of homeschool. That was pure torture. Panic all the time while there, general anxiety must have developed there. That stacked with social anxiety. Depression very quickly escalated. 2nd year homeschool I started to hit myself and eventually cut myself. It made me feel better for a minute, I liked the rush it gave me. It felt good to hurt myself, to punish myself for sucking at everything I did.  I Forgot to mention my whole teen years I've had acne, covered my face since I was 13. Also generally ugly, that didn't help. I wanted to have a relationship, I wanted to go to parties when I was in highschool. I wanted to do so many other things.
 
Suicidal thoughts started happening about 2 years ago from today. Then got serious this past year. I got a job, and I work full time while I finish my senior year now. I have no idea what I'm going to do if I finish school. We're poor. So poor I could have had free college. I couldn't do it, too scared and too stupid anyways. Told her some lies. I just was too scared of being alone and in a big university or something, having to deal with other people again. So scared. The anxiety took over. Lost that opportunity. Now the place I work at has this girl I really like, shes out of my league and we talk sometimes, obviously only as co workers. Every time I think of her my chest hurts, alot. I can't put into words the pain I feel when I think that I'll never get to hold her, we'll never be together.  I Don't wanna linger here, it hurts to think about it, to think about her. I stopped sleeping around this point. I probably sleep a few times a week. Mostly staying up all night. I don't know if I have insomnia, but we can't afford meds for anything anyways. Not that I would want help at this point.

At this point the cutting has become a severe addiction, I'm cutting deep now but my mother doesn't know. It's hard to walk alot of the time. I've never really cut on my wrist and I've become so sheltered she doesn't question me when I always have a shirt and long pants on. I don't remember a time when I was really happy. It's hard to get bandages, it hurts alot. I dissociate alot now, and I actually don't mind it. It doesn't hurt so much when I dissociate. The mental pain eases when I go into that state.
I have tremors in my hands, so they shake a lot and it's hard to control light weight and small things. No idea when I got that, dunno how it developed.
 I've already tried to hang myself once before, and it didn't even hurt. I started to fade and it felt nice. The edges of my vision faded and I almost did it, but it's so hard to fight the natural instinct. so hard. The voice I have in my head shut up for a second, but this past few months it's been much more calm thankfully. I got drunk on Christmas, that was nice. I just laid there. Lonely and hurt. The thought of death comforts me now.

I'm sure I missed some key points, but life is just going to get so much harder very soon and I don't see why I have to keep going.
I've got 2 months until I'm 18, I have severe scars covering my shoulders and a thick layer of large scars on my thighs. 3 big scars high on my forearm. It's obvious what they are. It's so so hard to fight the urges. My mother hasn't seen any scars, ever. I am very careful. Why would any girl ever want to be with me? I can't go swimming. I can't take my shirt off. I can't even wear short sleeve because the scars stretch down from my shoulder because I had no more fresh skin to cut. I don't see a reason to keep going, all the color has faded from this world, I don't care about anything anymore. Nothing has value. Everything is boring. I can't remember a time when I was ACTUALLY happy. As in not faking it. Actually alright.

I never understood why people always needed someone to care about them. I just wanted a family and a lover. That's all. All the songs about suicide I listen to always jam in your head ""PEOPLE CARE PEOPLE CARE!!!"" 
So? What does that solve? I still have all my problems..? Maybe its because I never felt cared so I never needed it, I have no idea. At this point I really don't care. I don't want help. I don't want to be happy because this life is pointless and it HURTS to live. Can you understand that? It. Hurts. I don't care if it gets better, I've waited a decade for that. I can't take another week, how can I get through the next 2-3 YEARS while I get a place of my own and *somehow* get a decent paying job with a highschool diploma? All while I'm alone? Tell me that. I don't get how it's comforting that I'm ""not alone"". Okay? Strangers feel the same way I do.. 
That just makes me feel worse, all these people suffering. All the evil in this world, and everyone is suffering in it. Why would that ever make me feel better?? World war 3 will inevitably start and I'll be drafted to kill innocent people. 

Not trying to put down anyone that feels better when people say that others feel the way that they do or that others care, but I can't comprehend it I guess. I don't know what happens the next time I get my hands on a gun. I'll probably put it to my head and pull the trigger. Like I said I don't care what I leave behind. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've never been completely honest about my life before, this is the first time I've ever written this out. I don't know if anyone will read it, but I hope someone reads this whole thing. At least one. Whoever you are, I hope you find the one you love and you truly find happiness with them. I really wish everyone could be happy and be at peace. I don't know what happens after this life, but I don't understand why it would have to be more suffering after this life. Why would something create us just to hurt? Why keep making me hurt like this after I die? Who would do that.. that's SO HORRIBLE. Evil. How can you send someone to ""hell"" (unimaginable pain and suffering) **for eternity** for ending one's pain here on earth? What kind of logic is that? What? I don't see how someone can believe in that, because I can't. 

I'll take my own life soon, and it won't be a tragedy. No matter what anyone says, it won't be a purely selfish act. It *isn't* sad that ""he had to die so young"".

I know I didn't answer anyone, but I was too fucking depressed to get on the goddamned computer to read what you were saying. 

Anyway... I guess I should say that nothing is much better. /: Though we all know stuff doesn't go away overnight... though my cat is doing okay. She sleeps a lot now, for being so young...

I didn't mention this in my last post, really... but I realized that I have to. 

Basically, between junior high and high school I tried killing myself twice. I have never been to that point again, but pretty fucking close. I never expected I would be alive to go to college. That statement is 100% true. So I decided it would be good if I spent a lot of time on my school work until the day I died so I could have something to do, to take my mind off of it.

I ended up getting a 3.9 or 4.0 every year. I did okay on my SAT. I just didn't take very good courses. I took things I enjoyed, because I'd figured I'd be dead soon. So I took things like photography and regular English instead of AP classes or even another math class that would help.

College rolls around... I don't know how I'm still here. I'm depressed as fucking hell and to this day I don't know what made me stick around to even get into college. The universities I wanted to go to (none even that great) all rejected me because I didn't do well enough or something. It was really hurtful to any esteem I still had left. It hurt because I could have done better... somehow...

Fast forward to now. I'm on my 3rd semester at a community college I didn't want to go to in the first place. I don't hate it at this point (that might be a lie), but it's not what I wanted. I figured it was okay since I was saving money, but it still hurts sometimes to think my decisions in high school did this to me. I am just cruising by with my classes... not doing exceptionally well or anything. I definitely didn't put all my effort into them. I got a lot of Bs and Cs. I have two As out of 10 classes. 

Within the last month, I decided I would set a goal to go to want to transfer to USC. I know... it's way too high of a goal for me. I haven't told anyone I want to go here except my boyfriend who is... supportive... but he's really realistic about it. I don't know why I chose that school. Probably the same reason anyone else does... for the image, the novelty... being able to say you went there. He tells me I will have to fix my GPA. I would need a 3.6 at the minimum, but I have a 2.16 or something horrible like that. Or I would have to do a fuckton of extracurricular activities. There's really nothing I can do but apply and get rejected, and go to a school that already rejected me.  He's suggested a lot of things I could do to achieve this... but it would involve being in school for years longer than normal, or forgetting about all those grades because they were on a different campus than the one I am currently at. I don't want to go to community college for 5 years to just get rejected anyway.

It's hard enough for me to make a decision to do something with my life. But I can't get over that my previous decisions have fucked me over for what I want to do now. I feel like such a failure to myself. 

I still haven't been able to find a job and I am on the edge. I am on the brink of quitting but I have bills to pay. I almost want to say ""fuck the bills"" and get into a really expensive school so I can kill myself and just know that I was able to do it, then I won't have to deal with any of this.

How do you deal with the fact that your life will never be anything you wanted it to be? I cry every day thinking about it. I am sitting in a coffee shop right now typing this (because if I stay in my home I'll just think about ways to off myself) and I'm tearing up and people are looking.

I feel like I've fucked up way too badly to keep on going. I feel like I am doomed to a life of being depressed because of those stupid decisions I made and how it'll just be a large chain reaction through life, settling for shit the entire way till I finally die. I don't know if I can handle having things to show for being alive, but not doing anything I actually wanted.

I'm pretty sure my decision to transfer to that particular school is a bad one. I am going to get rejected. I just already fucked up too badly. It fucking sucks. I already missed the deadline for next year... but if I get rejected, I'm pretty sure I'll kill myself. I'm not obsessed or anything, but it's kind of like my last hope to do something I want to do... or have my life go in the direction I want it to, and I can't fix it after that. 

I have people all around me going to schools out of state, that they can afford, are having a great time... and they never made a fucking stupid decision to die so now they get to do what they want. It makes me so jealous to no fucking end but it's my own fault. (Now I'm crying.)

My boyfriend is in grad school and I hate to sound like a bitch or like I hate him because I don't, but for fuck's sakes he doesn't even speak English that well. He's only been living here for 10 years and he has better grades by just doing mediocre work. He's fucking brilliant, and when I think about that, it fucking hurts. As far as I know, law school is fucking hard. Yet he only studies for a couple hours a day and still is getting 95%+ on all of his work and passing his midterms with flying colors as I fucking type this.

All because he never made a stupid fucking decision to die. He had fun in college and gets to go this super awesome private school that only takes like 800 people a year out of the 10,000 applicants they get.

I fucking hate myself and all this goddamn un-fixable-ness. I have seriously considered applying to the school and telling them I've tried killing myself but have changed and will be one of the best students they have ever seen if they just give me a chance.

**That's what my life has come to. The fact that a fucking *school* is the last thing keeping me here is disgustingly pathetic. I feel fucking dirty and no matter how many times I shower, I just feel filthier the next day.**

I am so over living.

I want to stop giving a shit about the school I'll never go to, the bearable job I'll never work at, the people I will never know, the people that will never care, and the life I will never have. I want to be content with life, as painful as it might be. I don't give a crap, I just want to accept my shitty decisions and be okay with living a boring life (to me). I also feel this huge burden of guilt because everyone around me had supplied me with things I needed to do the things I want. My dad got me a laptop a couple years ago. My boyfriend gave me support. The internet also gave me support when I needed it... but no, I was too deep down in this fucking hellhole to get myself out and use these things. Instead I wanted to be selfish and end it without caring. I obviously failed, and now I have to live with it, but I'm such a fucking failure; a weak-minded coward that I can't even live with a decision I made and say ""It was stupid, I'm different now"" because *no matter how many times I say that, my life will still be how it is.*",suicide

I had psychotic breaks, the first of which I don't remember at all and the second I remember all too well. The hospital trips each lasted about two weeks, and they were HELL. 

After the first trip to the hospital, they put me on a lot of meds. If I remember correctly, it was Ativan, Prozac and Risperdol. I struggled a lot. I felt worse than I did before being hospitalized. After being discharged I went through bureaucratic hell, having nowhere to turn after my first hospital trip. Even my therapist couldn't get the folks from the hospital to send her documentation of my stay, and I was not set up with any outpatient care expect to see a nurse practitioner to talk about my meds.

When I ended up in the hospital a second time, I was once again placed on a seemingly random cocktail of meds. The doctor was very rude to me and did not listen to me pleas to be discharged. He did not take the time to get to know me. It was a different doctor than my first trip. I ended up going to court to fight to get out, but I was denied. I did get moved to a better unit (my roommate had hit me in the middle of the night, another patient threw a chair at me, etc.) Now it's on my record that I've been to the hospital. 

When I was finally discharged, my therapist fought to get me into a DBT group therapy run through the same organization where I was hospitalized. Honestly, it didn't help at all, and eventually my work schedule made it so I couldn't go anymore, which I was okay with. I also stopped taking my meds and started taking St. John's Wort and 5-HTP which have seemed to have some positive effect. 

The day after the second trip, my boyfriend broke up with me. After that I had the worst summer of my life, basically didn't see any friends and just worked, then came home and spaced out until work again. I cried a lot. The ex-boyfriend and I ended up hooking up again for a couple months, and a month ago I was diagnosed with herpes. He is the only person I have slept with in a year and a half, and it was crushing. He claims not to have slept with anyone else, and did get a cold sore shortly after giving me oral sex, so that is possibly how I ended up with this STD. 

I feel worthless now. He won't answer my calls and barely talks to me. I don't have any close friends I feel I can talk to. I feel like no one will ever love me now that I have this STD. I know I'm going to die alone. My only family is my Dad, who just turned 60, and my severely disabled sister who functions at the level of a 5-year-old. Barring suicide or a freak accident, I will surely outlive both of them, and then I will be truly alone. 

The problem with suicide is that it is so fucking difficult. This may seem like an obvious statement, but it really is. I've tried a few methods, none of them have worked. Other methods don't seem like an option. I'm too scared to jump off a building or anything like that. 

I don't know what to do now. I live alone with my dog. I love him so much, but I know my Dad would take him in if anything happened to me. Unless I go to the bar and drink away my feelings, I pretty much sit at home by myself. 

Suicide truly seems like my best option, and yet, I don't know how to do it. ",suicide
194453,"Never thought i would be here but here i amYou can honestly say i live a shitty life. I have really big problems that can't be easily solved. One of them is that I am a 27 year-old male virgin, who is socially awkward and really insecure. I used to be bullied for being morbidly obese back in school. I have lost the weight now though. I thought things would get easier, but they feel worse somehow. Everyone expects me to have gfs and get laid and all that but i don't. I haven't even made out with a girl and first kiss was last year. I just don't feel capable and don't have any motivation in me to chase girls. Life is really challenging for me. I have never known what real love or intimacy is outside my imagination and thoughts. My parents give me alot of shit. My dad said I'm an embarrassment. I recently heard that two of my teenage cousins, who are 15/16 lost their virginity to some girls and now they have gfs. That really killed me on the inside and made me feel even worse about myself. I don't understand why I'm like this.

My other huge problem is that i am stateless. Which means i am not a citizen of any country so I'm in limbo, no papers, no legal identification to travel, work or drive. I'm like a ghost. I have tried everything, i have filled out forms..it's been three years with no results. All i can do is sit back and watch how other guys can enjoy their lives, being normal while I'm a virgin ghost lol. So you can see why i am contemplating suicide. I have tried to cut myself some months back, to no avail. This is not a life. I just don't know how i could continue. I'm so tired and sick of false hope and expectations. 

Oh and now i face legal trouble and on probation, so i have to wait until it is over to do anything about immigration. I feel like I'm in hell. 

I just know that there isn't anything or anyone could do to help me recover and get my life on track. Meds aren't helping either. The only thing that is keeping me going right now is just a sliver of hope for the future and my Mom.",suicide
114556,"How often can you think about suicide and have it be ""moderate""? Can someone provide a frame of reference? Or rate my suicidal ideation? I don't know if I'm being dramatic.I feel like I'm so far removed from a healthy thought pattern that I don't know what's in the range of normal.

I know that never thinking about suicide is the healthy ideal. 

But how often does a ""moderately"" suicidal person think about suicide? What do those thoughts entail? Can you provide examples of the difference between passive and active ideation because I feel like there's a lot of unacknowledged grey area in there.

I'm sorry for asking so many questions.

I probably think about suicide... a few times an hour on average? I have a hard time quantifying it. I usually spend the first hour or so of the day grappling with these thoughts and trying to will myself out of bed. On bad days it's more than just one hour. Then anytime anything stressful happens I'll have really intense thoughts of suicide. Sometimes I feel like ""I NEED TO KILL MYSELF"" is screaming in my head and it helps to say it out loud or write it down. Anytime anything goes wrong, I do something wrong, someone is annoyed, I'm annoyed, I jump to suicide. This is passive right? Because I'm not actively planning?

On really bad days I think about how, and when, and toy with actually doing something about it sooner rather than later, but I never come out of that with concrete plans. Sometimes I have an urge to do something impulsively but it's still easy to shut down. That one worries me a little bit though, it's kind of new. I've been suicidal since I was 11 (I'm 28) but it was always slow and calculated, so the fact that I'm getting sudden urges to just *jump* doesn't feel great. But mostly it's still the long game, I won't kill myself until my parents die because they'd be too sad. I have friends and other family but they would recover, idk if my parents would. 

I don't know what I'm asking, I just genuinely have no frame of reference for what's normal. How often do normal people think of suicide? Are my thoughts normal? Is this mild, moderate, severe? On a scale of 1-10 does this count as being suicidal or am I over reacting?",suicide

The same facilities where I was almost strangled to death by an ex-con in the bathroom. The same facilities where I saw a man stabbed through the arm, and another beaten black and blue by the orderly. There is no healing in those places.   

People treat me like freak for struggling with PTSD. My friends distance themselves from me, my neighbors mock me, and my adoptive family cut almost all ties years ago. My therapists talks to me like a child and tells me to just cope indefinitely.

118160,"A friend told me to ""just die"".I met him on Tinder, he lives in a city on the other side of my country. I flew out to his city because he asked me to visit him. When I told him I bought the ticket, he said he didn't like surprises. Maybe I was supposed to check with him first/arrange it? We had been talking about it for a few months. He acted disgusted and too busy for me. He told me to stop writing him. I spent $1,200, so I still went and just hung out with friends. I know about 30 people who live in his city and I had never been there.

The last day I was in his city, I texted him and he didn't want to meet me in person but was friendly and wanted to be friends still.  Once I came back to my city, we started talking again. I considered him a friend/was still falling in love.

Fyi, he is a real person and is the person with the name he gave me and all of that is confirmed. This is where I fucked up:

(While we weren't talking and before I flew out there I spoke to his ex girlfriend on social media. I asked her if he was abusive to her. She had posted a story online accusing him of abuse, he denied it. After talking to her I decided I still wanted to get to know him, that's why I texted him while I was in his city.)

So, we became friends again and I told him I had talked to her. He flipped out because I talked to her and that is when he said these things to me in text:

He told me to ""just die"". He called me a ""cunt"". He said I am ""damaged"".  I emailed him about 6 times after asking if he was serious about me dying and he doubled down. He called me stalker. (I have never stalked him and I don't know what he is referring to.) He said to stay out of his life and not to contact his family or friends.

(Early on I had sent him an expensive vintage punk magazine but I never even kept his address. I don't know even know who his friends or family members are. The ex girlfriend made her post public and it was still linked to him on Facebook. It is the reason I ever even read it.)

This happened in November 2019.

Lately when I have been getting upset or having a bad day, I think he might be right. He is the fourth person to tell me to die. The other was an abusive ex who was my only and first boyfriend for 8 years, who I lost my virginity to. My mother who said it to me once when she was mad. She also told me I was a mistake pregnancy when she was mad. And a friend who was drunk and on drugs and who was mad at me once told me to die.

I am in therapy and AA for alcoholism. I am sober and have a sponsor. But this thought that I am worthless to this man I loved is hurting me so much. What do I need to do to work on processing these thoughts of uselessness?

121028,"Extremely depressed 24 year old... Thoughts of suicide for years...HelpPlease forgive the many grammatical mistakes. I didnt have time to proofread everything.

My life is a story of misery and loneliness. I've just had a huge row with my family this morning (again) and I can safely say that I count on no human being, not even my family to support me in my darkest, most depressing hours. I will write my story here in the hope that maybe someone out there will read it and perhaps understand where I'm coming from. Maybe this will be my suicide note and someone can track my family to show this to them.

To know about my life, first you need to know a bit about my family - mother, father, older brother (29), his wife and 6 months baby, younger sister (22) engaged and to be married this year. I will write a brief biography about each of them.

Father: Probably the only one I least hate in my immediate family (apart from my 6 months old nephew). He grew up in a poor household but managed to get himself educated despite coming from no money, and now works in a high paying job. All opportunities that I've had in my life are an indirect result of his early life choices.  If he had been like any of his brothers (4), he would have lived the rest of his life like them broke and leeching off of relatives. But he payed my way through university for which I will always owe him a huge debt, even if it's unpayable. Now my father isn't a complete saint. First, he is an extreme miser, he has never given any money (even insignificant amounts) to his family without a lot of arguing or oftentimes, refusing outright,  even though he earns a ridiculous amount of money. Sure he pays for the house and utilities ( he gives a very tight budget) because my loser of a ****head brother has been broke and jobless all his life so doesnt contribute anything to the house. And i've noticed all my life that he has been especially stingy in giving me not a cent more than what was absolutely necessary i.e basically food and a few clothes - he never bought me a toy when I was a kid but simply handed me down my brothers broken toys thinking I'm too stupid/gullible to ever notice. Secondly, I found proof two years ago that my father had slept with another woman. I've kept this secret to myself and don't blame him because of my mother which I will explain in the next paragraph. Ever since I was five, my father has always been away on ""jobs"" in other cities so we were always at home with our mum and he would visit us once a month for like 2 days to check up on us, spend some time (mostly watching tv or going out to visit his old buddies) and then left to come back next month (this cycle has gone on basically all my life - to my siblings and I, this is just normal life now). Even when we managed to change our home to his work city, he would soon find a better job in a bigger city and then the same thing went on with him never being around. Thirdly, my father is very emotionally detached from us (basically because of my mom and recently, my brother too). When he comes home, he rarely talks to us. He has often told me in confidence that he has been depressed for a long time and that once you are all ""settled"" in life (marriage, job etc), I will fly off to europe and leave everything behind. He also tells me that I am his ""ONLY"" hope in leaving behind a legacy of some worth since his elder son has been an abject failure.

Mother: To put it very briefly, my mother is the MAIN problem of us all. She is a controlling, highly, highly paranoid schizophreniac. No not thr kind that goes around the house waving a knife or make us fear that she will kill us in our beds any day. But she's not normal. She HATES my father to the core of her being. She will NEVER say a good thing about my father in front of us or anyone (she'd rather keep quiet depending upon the company she's in instead of accidentally saying something good like maybe the comfortable life she lives is because my father has been working his ass off for her). She basically considers him the sum of all evil and every supposed plot against her (to steal her tiny savings ofc) is being led/orchestrated by my father and his siblings (most of whom have their own busy lives to live). To give you an example, if one day a small snake pops up in our garden during a rainy day or if there's a spoon missing from the cupboad, she would think it's our father and his relatives who payed the maid/gardener to do it simply to annoy her. In those rare moments when I asked her out of anger why would anyone consider you significant enough to invest so much time and energy just to annoy you and why can't you see it's all just paranoia, she simply spites me and says you're an idiot/my dad has cast a dark spell on me or her favourite line now, ""you're not my son"". We've tried to convince her to get treatment for her paranoia many times but she adamantly refuses to point of going literally nuts. She is the reason why everyone in our family is afraid to come to our home or spend time with us. You can guess she has no friends either, just my sister to keep her company. I still try my best to be a good son and not let he venomous hatred for everyone get to me, but honestly there are days when I wish she peacefully dies in her sleep and we won't have to suffer the psychological damage/pressure from her ALL the time.

Sister: I used to think my sister, despite all her flaws, was deep-down a good person. I've come to realize I was wrong. She is an extremely manipulative scum who always gets what she wants. She will fake crying, drama, create urgency just to get others to do whatever she wants (my mum ALWAYS supports her - she's her only daughter and all). She never asks anything from me, she demands it and if not given to her, she would start venoming like my mother about how I'm not her real brother and how I wish you were dead at birth (my arms often shake from restraining myself and giving her a huge slap but I can't because I've been programmed that you can't hit a girl no matter what she says or does). I've still occasionally tried going against my nature and do what she asks to see if it changes her nature. Her usual reaction is to act as nicely as possible when I'm doing her errand but the moment it's done, it's back to bitch mode and she will never do anything for me when I ask her. Frankly, seeing her personality transform over the years from a relatively shy and honest girl to a sly, badmouthing bitch who uses the fact that she's a girl to get things her way, I would rather not have any close ties with her in future after she's married off. Only the occasional hi at a family gathering would be more than enough for me.

Brother: With my mother, my brother is the MAJOR reason why I often seriously consider killing myself, just so I wouldn't have to be around him anymore. My brother in brief: he started studying ACCA (accountancy) when he was 18, finished 2/3rds then kept failing repeatedly and quit (blamed the examiners for not passing him but never blamed himself for quitting), then started working online for a few months and saved a bit of money, but a year later spent it all with his ""friends"" on a trip to thailand n malaysia. then he started studying for CFA (still all fees payed for by dad ofc ), finished 2/3rds then simply left it saying he'll resume it later when he is less busy (I wonder what' he busy in since he has never had a job in his life). Got married 1.5 years ago, sweet talked dad into spending an ENORMOUS sum (way beyond our means) on his wedding (we have 3 day long weddings in Pakistan) I kept telling him to not waste so much money and maybe use some of it to start a business after getting married - he told me to piss off and worry about my life, not his. Also, it's important to mention that in our society, the elder brother is sort of the default head of the family after Dad, and since dad is never around, he likes to act as HEAD of our house. Today, my brother is a 29 year old slacking ba*ta*d who has a wife and kid, never had a job in his life, says he applies for jobs occasionally (and never gets called because he has no degree) spends all day around home doing grocery shoping/wacthing tv and living off comfortably with money a checque dad sends every month to him (to take care of us all). My dad is not a business owner. He is 60+, has a heart condition and literally travels EVERYDAY in order to earn for his family. When I tell my brother to look at our dad's condition and try to get a job, ANY job, he blames it on the companies for not responding to his CV or not contacting him with an offer. My dad has always loved my brother more than me (being his first born son) but after seeing what a miserable loser his son has become, he has resigned himself to this fate and occasionally even cried in front of me to tell me what a disappointment his elder son really is. My dad tells me how he is getting weaker every day from exhaustion and that he can't continue like this for much longer. My brothers reaction when I tell him all of this: It's not my fault, there are companies in other countries who would hire me in a second but I'm staying here to take of you all so you should thank me. WHAT? If grocery shopping is taking care of us, we can take care of ourselves. He also verbally and psychologically abuses me whenever I get on his case about dad or work, by telling me I'm a fat loser who doesn't have any friends and no one loves me, not even his family. I have made up my mind that once mom and dad are dead, I will take my share of inheritance and never be in contact with my sh*tlord brother again (who will probably end up broke/in debt and call me out for help which I will never give him)

and Finally me: I am a 24 year old engineer who recently graduated from a top engineering university of my country. I'm earning a lot working online and saving up to go abroad for a masters degree (something I very much look forward to since it will be 2-5 years away from my family). Because of constant moving around during my adolescent years, I've never really had any long-term friends and after slowly ""discovering"" the nature of my family members, I started growing distrustful of people in general. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not a hermit who has zero social skills or hates everyone from a corner. I am cordial in conversation, I have one REAL friend whom I can count on with my life and am humorous in day-to-day life (which I think is a coping mechanism that's naturally developed against my life long depression). I am not gay, transgender or sexually depressed, nor do I have a SO. I used to be very sensitive as a child but hardened up over the years so now it's just a constant state of passive depression+anger.  I usually stay in my room all day working because I don't like mixing with any of my family members, and don't go out much.

The most recent row this morning was over my sweet little sister banging on my door and telling me to take her to university (the driver didn't show up).  I told her my head was aching bad and she should ask the other brother. Moments later, my door was being heavily banged by my brother. I knew another shouting match was about to start so I opened it when he leapt at me. Long story short, we said some extremely nasty things to each other, my sis + mom completely backed my brother telling me to leave OUR home (it's not theirs ONLY) and I'm about to call my dad to beg him to take me with him to work away from these people (we sort of do the same kind of work).

I just don't think I can cope with this BS life any longer, what's the point of living with a family that drains out of you any energy you have for a making a good life for yourself. My mantra used to be ""This too shall end"" but I'm starting to believe it really never does. The scars your family leaves on you stay forever, even after they're gone. I seriously don't consider waking up every morning to go through this sh&amp;t again and again worth the effort. Why shouldn't I just end my suffering and kill myself in a nice, clean manner (like a gunshot to the head)?",suicide

He told me he felt that way in the past, and that something or someone comes along and changes you, but I don't think they understood that I would be incapable of caring if I was gone.

What's that word mean to me anyway
I've never really had one
And at the end of the day
I ask whatever's out there to put an end to this

I sit and think each night
Especially when the moon's bright
And just think
What what happen if I disappeared
And crumbled away to dust
Would they miss me
Or attend my funeral because they must

I wish I could find some peaceful place to rest
Something like a cozy nest
Somewhere up in the stars 
Maybe then I would twinkle down
And bring happiness to the people all around

I'm so tired
I wish I could rest my eyes
I'm so sad
I wish I could stop all the lies
That they feed us

I'm so stressed I feel I could blow
I wonder when it's time to go
I wish I could know

I'm so sad I feel like i could drown
Into salty black abyss I sink down
Into glittering black waters

I'm so angry I feel I could explode
Everything knawing me forcing me to erode
Until I snap
Life feels like a trap

I'm so confused I can't figure out where to go
Everything moves so slow
But then slips by
I'm not sure there's a point to even cry

Life is nothing but pain
Where so few get to gain
And the rest of us drain
All we have to feed
Those far from in need

So what is life anyway
It's not fair
Some get to play
But in the end we are made to pay

I wish I could blink away
Become a star
Or a new tree
So I could watch life go by
And finally be free",suicide

My sister has bullied me my entire life into thinking I was ugly. When we got older I gave her many chances to change her behavior but she‚Äôs definitely on the narcissistic Spectrum. She‚Äôs ruined the entire family but we no longer talk. After that I met a man who used me for sex from the age of 17-20 when I really thought he liked me for me. I gave him multiple chances because I wanted his validation. I was so dumb to think someone would really love me. My mom is so emotionally distant because of her own abuse and my real dad and stepdad are no longer in my life. I want to love myself but running into the same type of people is exhausting. I turned 21 6 months ago and met a man who I thought had good intentions. There was no red flags until I started realizing the whole relationship was revolving around sex again. This time I expressed my emotions from the jump and told him a little about my past so he knew I wasn‚Äôt playing games this time. We had our ups and downs but nothing we couldn‚Äôt fix until I messed things up by getting drunk and acting crazy. I felt extremely bad bc I let my anger out on him when I should‚Äôve expressed it sober &amp; I‚Äôve apologized countless times. I know drinking isn‚Äôt a excuse but I wasn‚Äôt in my right mind but I should‚Äôve never drank that night. I forgive so many people but no one forgives me am I dumb for giving people more than 1 chance. No one sticks around in my life I‚Äôve deleted all social media I could care less seeing what people post. I also lost my best friend a year ago from a heart condition she was the only one who kept me sane. I feel like why did God take her instead of me she‚Äôs way stronger than me. I‚Äôm tired of being miserable and pretending like things are going to get better they don‚Äôt. I could care less about sticking around for my family who doesn‚Äôt like me anyways bc of my sisters lies. I pray to die everyday I need to guts to end my life before I turn 22.,suicide

I've been together with my SO for a long time now, and they've been depressed since before we met. There's always been suicide talked about and I've always tried to talk to them through this. However, through the past few months it's gotten worse than ever. Instead of wanting to talk when feeling bad they just don't seem to listen or want to talk now. They talk about when they want to go through with it and how long they're giving themselves for things to start looking better.

I try to be as positive and helpful as I can as much as possible. I try to talk through everything or ask whats wrong, I offer to do things with them or try to talk about anything as often as possible to try to keep them distracted, but of course they are still going to think the thoughts that they do.

I've brought up if maybe antidepressants would be an option or therapy and while it seemed like a possibility before now it's immediately shut down, with no real reason as to why not give it a try. They live in another state than me so I can't physically be there for them or go to see them when they are feeling like this.

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt love you, people. I‚Äôm just not interested in life. It literally does not interest me. I find things to pass the time before I die. If I was told I had terminal cancer, I‚Äôd be relieved. 

It doesn‚Äôt even feel like depression anymore because it‚Äôs not sad to be, it‚Äôs just disinterest. O am disinterested in life. I‚Äôve been dragged to a party I never wanted to go to. I‚Äôve seen what‚Äôs to offer and none of it interests me so I‚Äôd like to leave. 

‚ÄúNo, no, stay. The party will get better, we promise.‚Äù 

Again, not interested! It‚Äôs just so...BORING. It‚Äôs dull. It‚Äôs more work than it‚Äôs worth. There‚Äôs bills, taxes, expenses. You have to work. Like it just sucks. I get that you‚Äôve found a way to make that enjoyable and you know what, good for you, I‚Äôm glad for you. But I‚Äôm not interested. No, I don‚Äôt want to write for a living even though I like writing. I picked writing as a focus because it made me feel good and I was good at it. No, I don‚Äôt want to help people for a living, it made me and others feel good and I had a talent for it. There‚Äôs nothing inherently fulfilling about life itself. I have nothing to gain from it and your pithy statements about how I just have to find my thing or my passion only exhaust me more. 

That‚Äôs the thing. I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôm done. I feel like my grandmothers did when they passed away. How my mom felt when she passed away. I‚Äôm just done. I‚Äôm weak.

Sometimes I think I‚Äôd like living if it didn‚Äôt require so much work. What if I could just stare off into the distance all day? No decisions, no tasks, no lists, no responsibilities. Just sit and stare. To have a mind uncluttered. That‚Äôd be nice. But it isn‚Äôt like that. Just to live, to have a place to sleep and fill basic necessities requires planning and thought and care. It‚Äôs too much energy, to even get the thoughts to stop swirling. They just don‚Äôt ever stop. Even to clear a space to write these words is a chore. I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôm exhausted.

She had a bit of a panic attack two thirds through the movie, these things happen. I was a little upset, but oh well. We get home and she decided she wanted to cook some food... I definitely do most of the cooking, so I jumped in a moment. This upset her and we had a bit of a collective breakdown (couple of gay ass lesbians here). And we each had our moments. She cleared up and went to the bathroom.

I've had issues where I hear voices and/or lose myself altogether. We've discussed this. We both have our own issues. But I had a pretty bad episode where I was talking to nobody and she was scared and literally ran down the street (about three blocks) to a co-worker's house and brought her over. When I came to, I was unaware of where she was and panicked.

My knives are so dull, I didn't get any further than carving a Jackson Pollock on my arm. My GF and co-worker bursted in the door as I was around cut 15-20 (honestly don't know).

The booming sounds were what saved me. No, embarrassment is what saved me. We all talked, co-worker went home, and now my GF is in my bed, passed out, and I still have the urge to keep going... I won't. But the urge is still there.

Along with this I signed a one year lease. The lease agreement is clear that if you try to leave early, you have to pay the remainder of the rent.

So later on, the girl who I've been talking about came to lunch (she was late because she was having a meeting with a teacher.)

Anyways one of the only chairs left was across from me, and while she could have found another, or moved the chair to sit with her friends, she chose to sit there.

Like I mentioned I'm a big introvert (like a lot of people) so I never really talk that often, especially to girls. We talked for a few minutes, but eventually the conversation dwindled, and she went to go see what her older sister was doing. She came back later because her sister was doing homework and we talked a bit more until the end of lunch. It was probably one of the best experiences I've had in a while, being an introvert.

Oh, and because of our conversation, I finally had an excuse to text her, and we are talking. For me, the problem is not getting someone's number, (we are a small close knit school, so that part is easy) it's finding an excuse to start a private text thread with them without looking wierd or giving them any ideas.

So anyways, I'm starting to think she's trying to have me as just a freind, but you know what, that's alright, if that's the case, I'm fine with that, but I suppose there's always the chance...

If anyone has any advice on what I should do, or if you've been in a situation like this before, I would greatly appreciate it.",non-suicide

[m/16]I am 16 and as a result of not receiving full attention as my Dad had to be looked after for the first 7 years of my life (Motor Neurone Disease)/not having a father figure etc, I developed a very bad selective mutism, where I cannot speak to my own family properly, and I can only do basic words and phrases, going beyond makes me feel like hell all over my body.


I live in the UK, so the doctors wont do anything and the mental health treatment is pretty much non existent, I haven't even been diagnosed because they don't care at all.

**but it gets worse**

My brother and sister never attempt to talk to me, I am an outcast, and I am pretty sure that they actually believe that I have severe autism or am retarded in some way, this is because they have never seen me speak to my own friends and strangers in a normal way (and it would kill me inside if they do, thats how SM works).

My mum cares about me, but doesn't realise the full extent, she has recently tried to help me by 'talking to me more like an adult', thanks.. I guess.. I mean I am 16 so it's about time. It doesn't help at all though, she doesn't understand my situation.

Before anybody suggests, no I **cannot write notes to them, it is a full on block on communication**.

This is probably my tenth or so cry for help on reddit, I am losing hope, I must keep going but I am losing hope. Can you imagine being silent inside your own house, being scared to talk around your OWN family, for 16 years and counting!? Just imagine, not being able to have a conversation with any of your family members, it's essentially like being an orphan, but worse in my opinion. Why? 

I cannot have friends over. They cannot be in the same house as me or any of my family, as the thought of my family hearing me talk normally kills me and I cannot do it in front of them.

One time my mum insisted I have a friend round for a weekend, so I did. It was quite horrible, sure it was fun when I locked the door and played games in the attic with him, but when I went down to eat at the table with me him and my mum, I sat in complete silence. Complete. Silence. And he was probably wondering what the fuck was going on, nope just completely normal for me.


**I need help**. But I don't know what to do. I really do not know what to do anymore. I am 16 and I am running out of time. I don't even know if this is curable, I don't even know if it is too late for me, for all I know it could be, I could live a life without talking to my own family, and to me, that is the worst thing that could happen, and I'm not sure if I could live with that. 


I don't know how to go on, SM has been the cause of my depression, and it is the one thing that is holding me back from curing my depression (I can't not be depressed and have selective mutism at the same time, it is not possible for me).

And I lost one of my grandma last week (my father's mother).

I don't know if i'm mentally strong enough now, but i'm at a point where i don't know what to do anymore with my life. I mean i'm living with my mother, i have some friends at school, i'm still in very good terms with my brother and my sister, all of this is very fine, but i'm mentally not doing good. I'm crying almost every night alone in my bed.I'm 18 and I've been single my entire life because i'm too shy, and i'm afraid to bother girls i found cute because i have too much respect for them, which kinda sucks because i'm feeling alone and that's hurting a lot, and especially when i'm seeing that all my friends are in love with someome else...

Tbh i'm That type of friend who is the funny guy at school, but when i'm at home, i'm not good at all, because i have almost no friends to talk to. I'm spending a lot of time on my computer playing video games with my best friend trying to get away from the reality, but it's not always working.

I think your telling to yourself ""why don't you go speak to your family or friends"" and that's true, but i don't want to do it because I don't want my Mother my brother and my sister to be worried about me because they were a lot recently for my dad, and i don't want to talk about it to my friend because i don't want to bother them with my problems, they probably have some on their side.

Forgive me if this is the wrong place for this post, I do not know that I want to be talked down or saved. I don't think I can be saved nor am I worth the time at this point. The end comes because I made this path and followed it to this conclusion. Finally, at last, there's no way out of the problem. 

Through and through, I am one of our society's losers. And there are losers. Those who fail to establish themselves, or lose their footing and slip through the cracks. I like to think of myself as a bit of both, however, the truth is I likely am the former. I've always had little motivation for myself. But I was bettering myself in community college when I met a lady. We dated for almost three years before she broke up with me. I loved her, I was ready to change my whole life to be with her, to travel far away and be the housekeeper, the worker, while she went to graduate school. That of course never happened. I instead transfered to a 4 year university where I did exceedingly well my first three quarters there. I tried to prove to myself I could do as well as her and took an excessive 26 units of work that last quarter I did well. And I really knocked it out of the park; I'd never been so proud. After that.. I guess I just felt kinda burned out. I'd proved myself.. to who exactly? Her? She never would know of my success, and I never told anyone about this. I became more withdrawn from my friends. I sought therapy for a bit but the sessions were so pointless. I stumbled in my ability to talk about anything meaningful. And I took pills for a bit, but I stopped after a few weeks. I felt no difference. Then I stopped going to the school counselor altogether. 

The next three quarters in school I am on probation and do poorly. I get myself one final chance, and fail the class I need to succeed since I cannot get to class on time, both my fault and the fault of my car. Some days I just can't drag myself to do anything, and the final two weeks of the class my vehicle needed repairs. By this point I was so withdrawn from my friends there were none I could ask for help in getting to school for this period of time. So I fail and am removed. 

Now I am not even a dropout..I am removed refuse from the pool of students at school. During the time following that, over winter, I had some money remaining to pay my rent and bills, but it has run dry since I was unable to find any employment as well. Rent's due come Monday at the absolute latest, and I have nothing of value to sell. My computer MIGHT fetch 100 dollars then I am ruined so far as a job hunt goes. My car's ignition no longer works, so I have no transportation, no way of getting it to a repair shop, and worse yet, no way of paying for said repairs. All I have other than that are my clothes and kitchenware. Nothing impressive there. 

When I said it earlier that I am a loser of our society, I really meant it. I'm 29, a college failure, no remarkable achievements in my life. I have never done anything courageous. No gainful employment, I have amassed debt and cannot support or even feed myself at this point. In addition to all of the above, I've been balding for the past several years, I'm a bit temperamental, and always sad. Unattractive, and even worse, unsuccessful, who would bother hire a person who got kicked out of university? Apparently nobody. Even growing up folks always said 'you need to smile more' or 'what's wrong'. I don't know what's wrong. Maybe I'm just.. ""wrong,"" if that makes any sense. The only folks that will notice I'm gone are my bill collectors. 

But I'm scared. Not of dying, or leaving anything meaningful behind.. Really,there's nothing as you can see. No friends, no family in contact. No job. Only debt and failure. The thing that scares me most is that I attempt, and fail like everything else in my life; I wake up in the morning with no method of paying my rent and get kicked to the street. I think going this way would be easier than drawing it out on the street. I would never survive that life if I can't get through first world problems such as feeling sad. I just don't want to wake up this weekend. ",suicide

I have got to the point where I no longer know what it feels like to not feel worthless. Everyday I wake up wishing I had real purpose but feeling to worthless to even know where to start to get it. I feel as if I have no true friends in my life anymore. The closest friend I have is my girlfriend and it has been getting increasingly hard to talk to her. I am starting to feel like she is understanding how truly worthless I am and hating me in the same way I hate myself.


I have been catching myself in this loop where I am endlessly saying ‚ÄúI hate myself‚Äù in my inner voice, this has been happening for a few months now and it‚Äôs getting harder to stop. I have been working on things around the house to try to feel useful but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping. 


Lately I have been waiting for the day my girlfriend will leave me. I have been feeling a real disconnect from her for the last couple months. There is a resentfulness toward me that I am having trouble understanding. She has built herself up in a way I could only dream of, she has a great job, a degree, a great gpa, and she is making good, real friends. She worked hard for everything she has yet she looks at me with envy because I ‚Äúget‚Äù to stay home all day. My room feels like a prison and my mind is my cell and I can‚Äôt escape. 


I have no real release anymore, weed makes this depression feel like a broken dam were the emotion and worthless feelings pour out for anyone near me to hear and can‚Äôt be stopped. Gaming doesn‚Äôt help like it once did, I have no interest in programming anymore, and I have no one to talk to about any of this. Drinking might kill me because of this stupid random allergy I developed. Some days I really feel like the quote ‚Äúdrink your problems away‚Äù would apply very well for me.




10-29-2016


GF has said she feels like she spends all her free time with me in the past but in reality most that time is spent sleeping or unwinding from her work or school which I completely understand and agree that she needs that time but I just wish she would want to involve me in things other than going to the market or mall. 


I miss the days GF and I did things together and where I would actually feel like she wanted me there. I almost have to beg her to let me be apart of her life now. It gives me this almost crippling feeling of sadness that she doesn‚Äôt even think to involve me now. The way it used to be is if there was an event going on and her friends asked if she wanted to go, she wouldn‚Äôt even hesitate to ask if I could go along. Even when she does allow me to go with her now, after being asked,  it just doesn‚Äôt feel the same. I want to know what it feels like to be wanted again, right now I feel like I‚Äôm just being tolerated. I don‚Äôt feel like she really wants me there. At the same time I can‚Äôt blame her. I‚Äôm pathetic. I‚Äôm just going to have to get used to not really having the same place in her life like I used too.


I can rarely find things to do on the computer that interest me anymore. Maybe all I deserve is this room, forever doing laundry, making the bed, giving the pets food and water and nothing else. 
This depression is pulling me apart. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I want to see a psychiatrist but I need help but I don‚Äôt want to inconvenience anyone. That‚Äôs a good word for how I feel overall lately. An inconvenience. I want to like life again. I want to have a job. I want GF to respect me. I want to be respectable. I want to not hate myself. I want to feel wanted.


When it comes to GF‚Äôs work I just don‚Äôt understand why she won‚Äôt take time off. Not just for me but for herself. She feels this never ending duty to her job but never feels like her job owes her anything back, like a little leeway when it comes to time off, which they would happily give her if she asked. I know she works for the both of us but it would be nice if she felt the same duty to herself or to me that she feels for her work. Just weeks ago she wanted to quit and even then she was so against asking for a few less hours here and there. It has pretty much became a sin for me to even make the suggestion at times. She won‚Äôt even put a little thought behind it. She either completely disregards that she needs the time off or just gets angry at me for asking.




10-30-2016


I‚Äôm having a better day today. Last night I got to talk to GF about how I‚Äôve been feeling and she took it pretty well. It felt really nice being able to open up to her and she heard me out, which hasn‚Äôt happened in a while. I have to remember that GF has her own everyday battles. She isn‚Äôt trying to shut me out, she‚Äôs just exhausted and it is hard to hear about another person's issues when you have a week as full as hers. I just let my own insecurities bring me down. I just hope she continues to let me be open with her without it dragging her down into her own depression.




10-31-2016


Today‚Äôs another bad day for me. I can‚Äôt stop feeling shitty about myself. I layed in bed for the first few hours of the day but I‚Äôm trying to keep myself busy and not allow myself to lay back down. I know if I do I will just start feeling even worse than I already do. I usually start feeling better when GF comes home, hopefully today will be the same.


I‚Äôm looking forward to going out tonight but at the same time I‚Äôm letting my own self esteem and insecurities make me doubt myself. Her friends approval of me means a great deal to me because these are the people she wants to spend her time with and I‚Äôm hoping they will want me to come along.
My insecurities are also making me afraid of what GF may have told her friends about me. I still feel like she has been unhappy overall and I still can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm part of the reason for that, if that is true then she would probably want an outlet and she also got drunk the other night while out with them so she possibly let things slip. She deserves someone to talk to about me but I just hope it would only be friend of GF and I would hope friend of GF wouldn‚Äôt judge me to harshly or share what she says with other people. 


I ended up going and laying back in bed. I was trying not to but I couldn‚Äôt help it. I was feeling too shitty and couldn‚Äôt find anything I would rather do. Luckily GF texted me a half an hour later which initially cheered me up. Her boss told her to show me a halloween costume of a bloody pad and told me that was going to be my costume and paranoia kicked in and made me wonder if it was intended to be a somewhat hidden jab because of all the texting I was doing the other night. He also told her to tell me I have to choose between that costume or a few beers which again made me think it was a jab at me, it could have been him just messing around but I still think more was said the other night than she doesn‚Äôt remember or is choosing not tell me. She forgot that he had asked her to come in early on sunday which makes me think that there is a chance she could have said something about me and forgotten. I know it is probably just my paranoia but I can‚Äôt help it, my mind just keeps thinking these things and it affects me.


I just can‚Äôt stand feeling this crushing awful feeling that just won‚Äôt go away. GF is having a hard time right now and is planning on quitting her class and I feel like I still can‚Äôt be here for her in the way I would like to be. I‚Äôm not sure if what I‚Äôm saying is even helping or not or if I‚Äôm saying the right things to her because at the same time I‚Äôm just feeling awful. I just hope that I‚Äôm not the reason that she is feeling the way she felt today.

GF decided to quit her class. I‚Äôm not sure if she would have came to this decision if I never told her I was this depressed. I was worried that once I told her that I am feeling depressed the same thing that happen in the past would happen again. After telling her last time she also became depressed. We didn‚Äôt end up going out with her friends last night because she said she wasn‚Äôt feeling up to it so that could be a sign of depression.


I woke up feeling pretty down but pretty much as soon as me and GF left the house I was feeling better. Just getting out of the house for a few minutes and getting to talk and have fun even though all we were doing is going to the market and getting food real fast was exactly what I needed. If only going for walks to get out of the house helped like this than I would be able to help myself feel better but the last time I tried that it didn‚Äôt seem to do anything for me. Maybe I‚Äôll try again soon. Anyways back on to point. After GF left for work I was still feeling ok for a while but now I just feel tired and cranky even though I got 7 hours of sleep last night. If it‚Äôs not one thing it‚Äôs another. 


The only up side to the depression getting worst is that I don‚Äôt have much of an appetite and I have been losing weight. When I checked yesterday it looks like I lost at least 5 pounds in the last week. The downside to that is I need to work harder to make sure GF is eating and getting the calories she needs, because I will be thinking about food less.

I‚Äôm feeling a little bit better again atm, not sure why. It‚Äôs like a rollercoaster, I guess I probably should start writing the times on these paragraphs I write throughout the day. I‚Äôm going to go through the change log and do that for today after I‚Äôm finished. 


I really want to transfer these VHS tapes for my mom but I feel like everything is working against me. The wire we spent $80 on is still only showing black and white. I need to try it on my computer but that means I‚Äôm going to have to  bring the whole VHS player in my room and find space for it, fun! If that doesn‚Äôt work my dad wants to try a cheap wire from best buy which could work but I wish he would just buy it before I return this wire so I know how good it is and know if I should even keep trying on the $80 wire. If all else fails I am just going to have to transfer them all to dvds then rip them onto my computer then finally I will be able to cut unwanted pieces out, doing it this way will add a few long and time consuming steps. After I‚Äôm finished I can finally figure out how I want to make them available to family members if the clips involve them in any way.

Last night GF told me I have been holding her back from hanging out with her friends as long as she can remember. I‚Äôm making it hard for her to have a relationship with her coworkers because I would like to be included when they go out. I‚Äôm making her look like a clingy girlfriend to her friends and that they haven‚Äôt included her in things because they knew I would want to be apart of it. I see even more how much of a truly awful person I am. I never thought it was wrong to want to be invited when she goes out. I‚Äôm not really sure where I‚Äôm suppose to draw the line on things either. When she starts going out more am I supposed to be ok with never being invited to things, because I know that's what will end up happening. I‚Äôve had to ask if I can go to every single thing they have done so far. It‚Äôs not like these are only work meetings either. If they are mostly just fun outings why would it be a problem for someone to bring their SO with? She said it even put her in a awkward spot by wanting to go to Knotts scary farm which should be the least awkward thing for her to get me an invite to. Am I supposed to be ok if she makes what happen the other night a regular thing where she drinks too much and needs to stay with a friend? I don‚Äôt know if I can ever be ok with that and I don‚Äôt know if that is normal or if I‚Äôm just a shitty person.
The only examples of good relationships I have are my parents and my parents friends relationships with their SO‚Äôs. Every one of those relationships they do everything together and it isn‚Äôt a issue and no one is thinking any less of them for it. I just don‚Äôt even know what to think anymore. Maybe I‚Äôm not deserving of having a relationship at all. 


I have been thinking GF could probably have a much better life without me in it. Maybe it is best if I just start pushing her away. I have been feeling so stuck anyways. What will I do with my life. I‚Äôm such a piece of shit. I have no education, no work drive (not sure if that is because of my depression or not), I‚Äôm almost 30 and I already have bad teeth that requires more work. I‚Äôm just going to be a be a drain on GF‚Äôs whole life and I hate myself for that.
If I was to start pushing her away and eventually get to a point where I‚Äôm a distant memory to her then maybe I can find a nice way to leave this world without bringing to much pain to her. My biggest fear of killing myself is what it would do to my family, especially GF. She currently blames herself for things where she has no fault at all and I wouldn‚Äôt want her to feel responsible for me not wanting to be in this world anymore. 
It is my own fault for being such a big fuck up. I am the one dragging her life down. I am the one who will continue to drag her life down if I stay with her. I just really hate myself for what I have been doing to her.


I‚Äôm not sure how long it would take to push her away to a point where she won‚Äôt blame herself. One thing that I need to do is move over the VHS tapes to a digital format for my mom so she has something to look back on and see me. I haven‚Äôt talked about that being the main reason for wanting to transfer those over because I didn‚Äôt want GF to see that suicide has been in my thoughts as much as it has been but I stopped sharing this journal with her account. I just need to be able to write freely in here. 


I used to look forward to things but I feel I no longer have anything to look forward to. TV shows have been my crutch for far too long and they are finally not doing it for me anymore. I used to look forward to the next episode of something (even shitty shows like Arrow) and I was looking forward to the new Star Trek that will be coming out soon but I no longer care if I‚Äôm here to see them. I use to look at which of my shows were on what days and watch that as soon as they came on but nothing does it for me anymore. I‚Äôm not even able to pay attention to a show the whole time it is on anymore because I just keep hating myself instead.  


I‚Äôm not really sure what the best way to go will be. I don‚Äôt want there to be a body for my parents to find and I don‚Äôt want to ruin any of their property so that takes a lot of options out. I don‚Äôt want to use a train because there is too much risk of it leaving me around in even worse shape like it did to aunt‚Äôs friend. Maybe if I can find something that would be fast acting that I could take while on a walk or something.
I thought about talking to a psychiatrist but I‚Äôm not sure what that can even do for me anymore. Will that bring in a paycheck? Will that help me really get where I need to be in life to be able to provide for GF and myself? What do I even have to offer, I don‚Äôt even have a GED? 


It is going to be hard to push GF away. I love her so much and It will hurt every step of the way. Just writing that made me cry for quite a while. This will be difficult but I need to think of how I can do it.

I‚Äôm in the diagnosis process for a rare genetic condition that is caused by excessive cortisol to be constantly running in my system due to either a brain tumor or a tumour on my adrenal glands. The diagnosing is taking so long and I‚Äôm terrified for the CT/MRI result. If it comes back a yes i have to get surgery right away. If its a brain surgery, it would be a risky invasive surgery that requires a two year healing period - if i dont fucking die of surgical complications. Also the doctor said theres a chance it could be fucking cancerous. I dont even know if i want to know. 

If it comes back no i - still dont know what the fuck is wrong with me. I have a really really bad feeling it will come out positive. I have every single one of the symptoms, and when I was 13 for three weeks straight i had a recurring nightmare about this. In my dream i was in my bed laying down and i would ‚Äúwake up‚Äù to a voice speaking to me. I couldn‚Äôt see who it was so I asked them who they are and It identified itself as the tumor in my head. It laughed at me and told me its eating me slowly and i cant even tell. I woke up fucked up every time because it felt so real. I convinced myself that everyone thinks they have a brain tumor. I didnt tell anyone. I dont tell people my problems. Never have. Everyone thinks im pretty okay but its getting a lot harder to fake it lately. I just dont care anymore. 

My symptoms started when I was two years old, and now after 17 years Im finally in the diagnosis process at 19. I had to find out what the fuck is wrong with me MYSELF. The doctors always told me I was just ‚Äúgoing through puberty‚Äù or overthinking things. Ive been to so many doctors I KNOW somethings wrong with me  my body is breaking down this isnt normal. Over the years its just gotten worse and worse. Now at 19 theres a high likelihood that tumor has been inside me for 17 fucking years and nobody could tell me that. I had to find everything out for myself. If I realized at 13 that all my fucking ailments and my dream was telling me something fucking clear i wonder how i would be today. I only figured it out because my younger sister is beginning to portray the exact same symptoms. I researched for weeks to find this because i wouldnt let my baby sister go through this shit. The mortality rate is extremely high. 75-95%,  Ive had this for 17 years at least. I dont even want to know how short my lifespan is. I just want my sister to have a good life even if i die soon. Shes just a kid. 

Because of all the cortisol, the doctor said my brain and body is always in fight or flight mode. He wants me to get an evaluation from a psychiatrist because he thinks because of the tumor I have severe anxiety and depression (two more symptoms). I think ive been depressed for so long its all I know myself as. I remember wishing i could die at 9 years old. I didnt know what suicide was then. Im glad i didnt. For most of my life everything has just been gray. Ive always felt nothing, though sometimes I‚Äôd hit the peak of the wave and feel happy for a bit. I thought this was normal. I dont know who i am outside of this. This has been my entire life. 

The diagnosing process has made me more fucked up than ive ever been. My insomnia (another symptom) is the worst its ever been. I havent slept in two days now.  My possible depression is pretty bad too. havent drawn anything in weeks. Thats where i get out what i feel. When i try to draw it looks disgusting. Thats the one thing im good and i cant even do that anymore. Everything i do is bad in some manner. I dont even like music anymore. I just feel nothing. I wouldnt kill myself, but i wouldnt stop myself from dying either. I just want peace and calm and quiet. It would be so nice. I love the stars, and i still really do. Sitting outside under the stars listening to pink floyd makes me feel something. I have some hope left in me. 

I dont know if i want to see the result. If its a yes, i have to get surgery. I might die there in pain. Theres a chance it could reoccur, and theres a chance it could be cancerous too. Even if i get surgery the mortality rate is so high whats the point. I dont want my parents to pay all that for me to die a year later. Either way my entire life has just been THIS what a fucking waste. I keep having this dream of me just floating in space with my headphones in listening to maggot brain by funkadelic and its the most peaceful ive ever felt. Just floating in the stars listening to the riffs. When i die i want it to be like that. Alone for all of eternity. Just me and the music and the stars. It would be so nice. 

I just want my sister to get her diagnosis and fixed and live a good long life. Shes little. If i die, i want her to live a long and healthy life. I wouldnt kill myself because that would fuck her up. I know she depends on me and i love her too much to hurt her like that. She would never be the same. But in the end if i die from this 17 year old tumor i know she will be fucked up too. So i will live. For her. Ill fight for her. I hope theres no tumor and if there is, i hope it isn‚Äôt cancerous. I know its a dumb gamble to think that way since the likelihood is so high that my doctor isn‚Äôt even talking in possibilities anymore. I started writing my book because if i do go i want to leave something behind. I didnt get to do my phd. I didnt even get to finish my undergrad. I always wanted to have kids and know what its like to be pregnant. But its okay if thats not whats in the plan for me. I‚Äôll write my book. Ive already decided that if i die i want to be mixed with bodhiva seeds and planted in a protected forest if i cant be launched into space. Itll be nice and calm there too. But until then ill write my book. Thanks for reading this. I had no one else to say this to. 


Please dont tell me im over reacting to the possibility of the tumor. I dont think i am. I used to, but now its become too real. This is how i can prepare for the result.",suicide

91483,"Killing at least one mosquito every day, except each day I do it differently: Day #5 
Today at about 6pm (EST) I went outside in my front lawn with a plastic ziploc bag. I waited for no more than maybe 10 minutes before spotting a fairly large mosquito hovering around one of the lamps lining the walkway to my house. Like anybody else in the situation my first reaction was disgust at having to go within 10ft of such a vile creature. But I completed my mission successfully. It wasn‚Äôt too hard to catch the mosquito with the bag and I quickly zipped it up. I then opened the zipper a tiny bit on the opposite side of the bag that the mosquito was on and I squeezed out as much air as possible without crushing or letting the mosquito out. Then I resealed the bag and brought up to my room.
Fast forward to about 9:30pm (EST). I had come back to my room to check on the mosquito. And sure enough, the bugger had died of asphyxiation!

Alright guys, this is how I killed a mosquito today, let me know if you like the detailed story style or the straight to the point ‚Äúthis afternoon I stepped on a  mosquito‚Äù style

3037,"14 MonthsI can't believe it's 2013. My depression began at the end of 2011. In an attempt to get better I've been seeing a psychiatrist 2-4 times per month, and for a stretch of six months I met with both a psychologist and a life coach. 

With my doctor's help I've tried various cocktails of Zoloft, Lexapro, Abilify, Lamictal, Wellbutrin, Adderall and Ativan. None have helped my depression in a significant way. I've leaned on friends and family for support, improved my diet, and learned mindfulness meditation. (But I must admit I was never able to stick to the meditation for more than a week at a time.)

In short, I spent the last 14 months trying to get rid of my depression, but here I am tonight on SuicideWatch feeling as bad as I've ever felt.

I attempted to take my life last year, but my kidneys and liver were stronger than I gave them credit for. If I try again it will be with the help of the Golden Gate Bridge, which I'm told is 99% effective.

I know that if I continue to fight there's still a chance my depression would go away and I could end up happy again. The odds of this happening lie somewhere between 0 and 100%. But I also know that if I end my life the chances of the pain ending are 100%, and I won't be around to regret it. I suppose that's the tautology of suicide. Nobody who has killed themself has ever regretted it.

I'm practically convinced that ending my life is the better of my two options. The downside of course is the emotional toll it would take on my friends and family. But I counter that with the emotional and financial toll I'm already taking and would continue to take on them in the future.

Although I'm pretty convinced of my decision, I obviously haven't committed to it since I'm here asking for help. Your advice will be appreciated.",suicide

But because of my downright obsession with finding a girlfriend I can't just talk to women like I can men. I get in my own head about them. So the question was, how can I change that? 

I'm going to essentially brainwash myself into thinking no woman will ever love me. Completely loose all romantic and sexual attraction to women.

226118,"Don‚Äôt read if you don‚Äôt want to I don‚Äôt mean to take up anybody‚Äôs time at allI‚Äôm 21 years old and as long as I can remember I‚Äôve felt more than sad at different times. I‚Äôve always pushed it off with games, drugs, alcohol, and other things until it inevitably comes back up and I become very unmotivated and suicidal. 

The first time I‚Äôve tried to kill myself was when I was in third grade (8-9 years old) and I tried to tie a PlayStation cord around my neck and hang myself. My sister came up to my room and screamed. I felt ashamed. I was made to believe I was crazy or exaggerating the small event that had occurred for me to come to this.

When I was about 12-ish I can remember again trying this from something very small like my sister went in my room and played my game without asking. I didn‚Äôt know why I blew up and just freaked out mentally. I now think it‚Äôs kind of like ‚Äúthe straw that broke the camels back‚Äù or me pushing something deeper down when I play games or try my hardest to be happy or do drugs or something and then when it all comes back up, the smallest things will send me into a huge lengthy spiral of suicidal depression. 

I realize I try to find purpose or meaning and have all these fantastic ideas but every. Single. Fucking. Time. I lose all the motivation and all these interests I can sometimes put weeks or months of time into, and get back into this super depressive state. I don‚Äôt know why. 

The other day I was in this hysterical state and I almost killed myself but I got a random text from my father, it was a reply to a message the day before. So the last 2 days I thought I just needed purpose and meaning and I just have to try harder. So I felt happy until tonight at work I just felt so scared coming into the realization that this has been the same exact cycle I‚Äôve been stuck in for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôll never be happy. I‚Äôm so scared I will kill my self as I don‚Äôt think right when I‚Äôm in these states. I‚Äôm just so scared. I‚Äôm not in the place to be able to just get help. I‚Äôm just so scared.

I had already gotten over x8 my normal dose at least. She wanted me to come to her place so she could watch me, since she's also had her fair share of experience with this stuff. As we were leaving, I hid the bottle on me and she noticed and took them again. 

Well, I didn't die. I only had the effects of it for a few days after. Basically a mixture of weakness, dizziness, nausea, panic attacks and just tripping in general, etc. 

I'm worried that I... don't really have a reaction to having attempted. Now knowing that I didn't have fear doing it, I fear that when I get bad again.. which will be sooner or later as always, that I'll attempt again and succeed.  ",suicide
81062,"They never asked about the knifeI go by the name gilligan ( a favorite character from a book I like ) 
Im 23 I like think that im slim fit. 
Basic work out everyday, I like to fix things that are broken say it maybe a broken electric fan ill have myself electrocuted if I need to just to fix that thing or cut my fingers reparing a broken vase. 
My latest project was a laptop that my cousin bought for around 100k pesos (ph ) took me three days the power wasnt circulating properly and not turning the damned thing on. 
After a few frustrating days of sitting fown and experimenting I finally got the thing back alive. 
It felt like I just revived a person with my hands.
 It felt good. 
I dont sleep very often. 
Having an hour of nap or two maybe 3 would be grand for me. 
Most of the time im just on my social feeds just staring at animal photos. 
That cheers me up always. 
I always have these "" thoughts "" 
Say a girl says I look handsome its always followed by a voice saying she probably needs something from me or maybe someone gives me something as a gift automatically think that now I owe him .
Trust? 
Its not in my dictionary. 
These past months just pushed that word away from me farther. 
I had a girlfriend that promised me that shed never let go. 
You know what happened. 
I had a bestfriend of 15 years
Yeah we had up and downs. 
Before then I thought those downs were already settled. 
During the last weeks of my relationship my bestfriend told my girlfriend that he loves her. 
That basically came to me as a fucking tsunami againdt a small fishing boat. 
It all came crashing down after.
She broke up with me claiming that Im in the way of her studies. 
Even tho im always been supportive in all possible ways when shes stressed about anything study related. 
I make sure Im always there when shit goes down. 
And I know I did a good job. 
I am not a happy person. 
I have these momentary mental breakdowns 
Like waves of negative thoughrs pulsates through the layers of my mind. 
I have no way of dealing with it except just being quiet and let it pass through like rain to a sunny day.
Or a mist to a mountain. 
One night we three, me my gf and my bestfriend were hanging on the rooftop of my gf's condo just chilling yalking about stuff. 
And I had a fucking meltdown. 
I didnt realize its been 2 hours and ive just been staring at a fucking plant. 
Then when I woke up I just wanted to cry. 
I was crying on the inside. 
But on the outside I just smiled and excused myself saying I felt sick and wanted to go home. 
My bestfriend responds with alright I gotta go too. 
So yeah expecting them to head their own ways. 
I went home too with proper goodbyes and apologies. 
I spent another 3 hours staring at the ceiling of my room. 
After crying myself to sleep. 
3 am. 
I went out to look for food. Theres this 24/7 place near a bus top that night commuters take. 
And there I saw the two. 
Seemed like gf was walking my bestfriend to the bus stop. 
They seemed very surprised to see me. 
I didnt even speak. 
I just walked past them and kept to myself. 
My mind was all over the place. 
I knew what was going on but I was hoping I was wrong. 
My gf kept calling me. 
Asking whats wrong and saying how rude of me to ignore them like that.
I just made up an excuse that she easily accepted then things were as if nothing happened. 
Bf started talking to gf about my "" issues "" 
At this point I just tell myself just let it fix itself. 
And me being hopefull and wishing things would be different I let go of what happened. 
But I always get reminded with the fact that they talk more often than I do with my gf. 
My bf excessively gives more gifts to my gf. 
And seems to appreciate him more often that she does to me. The thoughts they pile up. 
But always, I always find the strength to push them away after all. 
They're only ""thoughts "" or "" intrusive thoughts as my gf calls it. "" 

After work I head to a net cafe to steam off. 
I receive a text that me and my gf needs to talk. 
Then I broke down. 
The person thats been slowly building me up and the foundation of my progress is about to let me go. 
So I asked are you gonna break up with me? 
"" im sorrry. "" 
I wouldnt take it anymore. 
I lost it. I went home got a kitchen knife 
Laid on my bed I lay on my stomach elevating my chest off the bed just so the knife ( handle to the bed the blade to my chest ) fits for 2 hours I was on a death plank. 
Quiet. 
No crying. 
Just blankly staring back into my pillows while my elbows supported my weight. 
After that. 
I just found myself drink 3 sleeping pills. 
The next day I didnt get off my bed. 
I couldnt eat or drink anything. 
I had no energy. 
My throat was dry. 
My stomach was grumbling. 
This went on for a full week. 
Then I started to cut my wrists again. 
Something ive stopped doing.
The last scar I had was from 2009. 
This was when my parents were throwing ceramic plates at each other like they were trying to make them fly like ufos. 


My cousins sends me a message "" yo I need help with my thesis "" 
I felt like I have a purpose again. 
So I gave everything I had into the new project. 
I was temporarily happy. 
I forgot about the small cut on my chest. 
Which have just recently stopped bleeding. 
And the cuts on my wrist started to dry up. 
Just perfectly covered by my watch. 
I can still feel the sting of when my sweat touches the wounds. 

Ive convinced myself not to care about what happened anymore..

Thanks my cousin says for sure anytime I reply. 
After that hes graduated from college

And noji. 
The other is recklessly childish and the other is slyly gay aleays hinting sexual stuff towards me. But theyre cool nonetheless.
This gal ive been following on one of my social medias.
I saw her promoting a desktop tower. 
Her smile stuck with me. 
Ever since I saw it ive always brought it with me then. 
I happen to come across a familair face on fb. 
It was her. 
"" Scarlett "" 
A few days was the length of my wait to finally message her and cope up the bravery to start a conversation with. 
Little to one word replies. 
This goes on for days and weeks
Ive given up. 
Shes not interested. 
But why? 
One I am a stranger.
Two who the fuck am I. 
3 I dont need to pull another soul to suffer with me. 
But I wont do anythi g to harm her. 
I want to get to know her.
If I could. 
I want to be close to her. 
Days of emptiness were broken by "" hey im sorry ive just been busy lately "" 
My heart,  you fucking have no idea. 
My heart. 
I almost had a heart attack. 
Thank you for letting me know. 
Its fine let me know when youre not busy :) I dont mind. 
Trying to be cool.
We continue to talk through the night.

Wanted to kill myself. These thoughts kept repeating for months and I was so miserable that I wanted to die. 

In an irrational impulse I contacted my ex because I was going to kill myself anyway so what the hell. What I did to her was fucking harassment. I wasn't thinking straight. She kept insulting me and then blocking me so I wanted to defend myself and I made new accounts. In the end she was SO angry that she wrote one last message that completely eviscerated me. 

There were some unfair things in it and it was so extremely mean that I couldn't stop thinking about it. Like just hour after hour I would hear it repeat and I couldn't deal with that. I would have snapped out of my bullshit mindset of dying of lung cancer by myself, but now I have to deal with THIS. So what I did was just constantly sending new messages on instagram begging her to reply and talk this out because I know this will repeat for at least a year. Would delete them later because my rational part of my brain knew that I was stalking her.

I'll be having a good time with friends only to switch off and picture drowning myself I just can't stop it.

I don't understand why it keeps happening; I am someone that has suffered with depression growing up and had a very stressful and disruptive childhood.

But that's all behind me now I became fully independent and moved out of my messed up childhood home at 21, and I have been trying to really invest in myself ever since , socially through friendships and trying online dating (not that it's really gone anywhere serious), economically I'm in training to be a low level lawyer and personally through taking up music and trying to read more.

But I still struggle to combat this background feeling of vapid apathy for my being alive - it's got better since becoming independent but I feel like I'm treading water mental health wise.

Any words of wisdom would be appreciated.",suicide

I'm still alive, I'm not sure how I feel.I went down the beach last night for several hours in the wind and rain, took a hip flask full of rum, got drunk and cut myself, not overly deep, just a lot of times, but it felt relaxing watching blood flow down my arm in the rain. Just standing shallowly in the waves felt really relaxing too. I was hoping it would just carry me away. I couldn't there though as people came along to nightfish.  

&amp;#x200B;

I got home in the early hours feeling as if I was going to pass out as I'd lost quite a lot of blood at this point. Completely stained one of my only white tshirts. I did the arm above head thing that someone told me on Reddit last week to stop the bleeding. I sat there on my bed just feeling numb for about an hour. Then I drank some more and took a handful of xanax, hoping it would kill me. I sat there for about 15 minutes listening to 'Only' by Anthrax. Suddenly I threw up. I guess my stomach couldn't handle all the pills and alchohol. I don't know how I feel. I was really hoping that everything would just end last night. I still feel shit about everything.",suicide
282215,"Third time's the charmTen and a half years ago: I'm standing in an open balcony of a high-rise building. It's very early in the morning. I'm thinking about the two girls from my old school that I bumped into while walking here. Funny how those two almost complete strangers are going to be the last people who would ever see me alive. I wonder what were they doing walking down the street nonchalantly at five in the morning. The barrier that separates me from my fate reaches almost to my shoulders. *I clumsily climb on to of it, somehow stand on it and jump.*

&amp;#x200B;

A year and a half ago: Once again I'm standing in an open balcony of a high-rise building. Different building, same city. Weather is different too: cold wind drains sensation from my fingers. I'm talking to someone on this subreddit, complaining that jumping from heights is not an ideal way to go: you have to conquer two fears, of death itself, and of heights. *I put my phone on the concrete floor. The barrier is similar in height, but I have grown. Still clumsy as always I climb on top of it, try to stand, but lose my footing and start tumbling down through the air. The last thought flashes through my mind: ""It's not the fall that kills you, it's the sudde*

5 weeks from now: I'm at my parents' house staying there during the holidays. It's two past midnight, I'm alone in my room. It's dark. Half empty bottle of whiskey is lying on my bed. A plate with some white powder on it. Alcohol and opiates, a sure way to go, if science is to be believed. And you only have to combat one fear. Thankfully my numbed out psyche can no longer feel fear like it used to. I contemplate on my broken life one final time, and as always come to conclusion that suicide is the most rational choice. Carefully I put a little of the powder on my finger and distribute it on the inside of my gums. Buccal route of administration might not be the most effective, but I don't trust myself with an injection. Half a minute later a feeling of warmth envelops me as my fading consciousness renders a song in a foreign language: ""and the whole life goes on endlessly without you"".",suicide

203597,"it was my birthday yesterday and all i've done is research how to do it properlyI wrote out a draft this morning at 4am to post because I couldn't sleep but I deleted it. Some part of me wants attention, wants someone to care, but I also don't trust opening up to people and have them think I'm weak and pathetic. I don't even know what to say or where to start. I never do. That's probably why I'm unable to even submit assignments for uni and end up failing. I just simply do not know. Even though yesterday was my birthday I spent it all wanting to die and researching how to kill myself properly. Even the one thing I thought might make it good turned out just like I feared it would. Nobody cared really; I can count the people on my hand who said happy birthday to me. I'm sure half only did so because they were coerced or something like my brother and because it was strange that a person I hadn't spoken to in a year and hadn't cared to say happy birthday to me last year, suddenly texted me out of the blue to say happy birthday. I was gonna just throw myself off a building but that doesn't seem very viable so I will just hang myself instead I think. Today I was testing putting pressure on my throat, first with my hands then with a belt. You see, I don't do this on impulse. I plan things out so it won't fail, I won't do this without knowing it's very unlikely I will mess up and fail. I was holding on until after my birthday to do it (bc of said thing I mentioned before) and I'm not even interested in anything anymore, not even the one thing that was giving me artificial serotonin or whatever so I kept living but now there is not a single difference between me sitting in bed all day, scrolling pages endlessly just to do something vs being dead. I can't imagine myself living past 20. Tomorrow I might just try to find some rope and practice with that, or I need to buy some but I can barely even make myself get out of bed and can't even take care of myself so I don't know how I will manage to. I don't even feel like eating and when I do eat I feel sick. I feel like my body wants me to die, just like my head wants me to so badly. 

I know nobody will probably even read this, and if they do they'll leave generic comments telling me not to kill myself, that they 'care' and 'love' me which only make me want to do it more. I do not like it when people pretend to care. i'll probably delete this anyway bc i know nobody cares really :)",suicide

Finally head to the arrivals section, call my dad, immediately get yelled at. ""Where are you? We've been waiting for you! You were supposed to be here 30 minutes ago, and I checked and your flight landed on time! What's that? I don't know where that is! I don't know where you are! Explain your location to me in more detail!""

The funny thing is, I pretty much knew where he'd be (it's an airport, you can only be in so many places), but he couldn't just wait for me to show up. He had to be a bully about it.

Turned around, pulled out my phone, bought an afternoon return ticket. 

I never left the terminal. I never even left the concourse. Got lunch right there, waited to board, came back home. Christmas is over for me and it hasn't even begun yet.

I'm not sad. I feel pretty good about it. Family bullies never expect you to call their bluff. They expect you to ""muddle through somehow"" because that's what everyone does. Doubly so when they know you've made travel plans and sunk cash into tickets. But hey, guess what? Low-cost carriers have some pretty cheap fares, even at the last second. Sometimes you can even get your original ticket refunded. 

Call that family bully's bluff, if you can. Don't let them drive you to suicidal despair the way mine has for so many years. Make that your Christmas present to yourself. Because fuck that person.

I can't concentrate on anything. I can't see myself studying, working, doing anything useful in life. I'm completely useless, not contributing to anything in society. And when I say that I mean it.

I'm in my senior year of college and while I am disappointed in the lack of participation of my fellow classmates, my professors made it an enjoyable journey of curiosity, exploration and seeking. Last year however, I became an RA (resident assistant) so that I could have the opportunity to not pay for housing. It lead me to a downward spiral that I hadn't had since high school. Rampant tales of sexual harassment by upper management that the school did nothing about, I would report shit that would lay at a desk somewhere unattended. It was taking a lot of energy out of my life and my grades were definitely taking the brunt of the damage.

My job is so unfulfilling that it makes me wonder what am I even trying to get out of living this tireless life of mine.

She begged me to be hers every day before I finally gave in and made my mind up and decided that this is what I wanted. She is my first relationship ever and we had so much planned together. This summer we had planned our week for when she would fly over and stay with me and everything was going perfectly.

I was the happiest I had ever felt in my life.

Then the last 2 weeks something changed. I don't know what but she suddenly became distant and I became frustrated. She was being completely unreasonable and would get so upset with me whenever I asked what was going on.

I don't understand what the point of living is when I can't put a finger on what it is that makes me, me. Souls don't exist. I am just a pattern. Another biological algorithm succumbing to entropy. I can never escape my perspective, which is subject to my external influences and my chemical reactions responsible for my emotions. Emotions are unreliable and create more trouble than they are worth. Vitality, fulfilment, or satisfaction are these states of being or emotions? If you couldn't feel anything would you know you are vital, satisfied, or fulfilled? Humanity as a whole is trying to replace its self with robots. Implanting our brains to biomechanical immortal bodies seems to be our next big leap. We don't seem to be doing too well in finding a way to allocate resources to everyone that is satisfactory. How can we focus on any ""great"" advancement or achievement when we can't meet the basic needs of our brothers and sisters? Morality is a confusing concept. I feel like some things are obviously wrong. Then again logic and reason tells me that morality isn't black and white. It definitely shouldn't be based on subjective feelings. Especially if we are applying it to the masses. I've thought about the problem of pain. Pain can be beautiful. It doesn't deter me from living. What deters me is the constant tug of war inside of me, between living off the grid and playing the role of model citizen. Life as an ordinary citizen seems to be encumbered with bureaucracy. Off grid seems isolated. We are social beings. I don't know if I have what it takes to cut it in the wild. It's becoming hard to distinguish what perspective is really mine. To the point that I don't feel real. I did something stupid today. I will face the consequences for it. It was stupid on my part. In the grand scheme of things, it was pretty minor. Yet the effects will be lasting. I feel like a failure all the time. Even before this mistake. I feel like a burden. I don't feel Like I contribute to society in a meaningful way. I don't even enjoy just being for the sake of being. I have trouble giving meaning to my life. I feel constrained. Claustrophobic. Like a starving parasite unwilling to devour its host.

At this point I believe I just don‚Äôt care about myself anymore. I'm only 15 (a sophomore), and I really shouldn't be having a problem like this at my age. I love academics I'm good at them. In fact amazing. All my tests scores (state tests and such) are perfect or nearly perfect, but I do absolutely no homework or even class work sometimes. I lie to my parents that I do, even now they think I'm doing homework, but really I am typing this.I got away with doing it for  4 years before getting caught at the end of freshman year (not doing hw that is) even now that they know they don‚Äôt really do anything they don't seem to care and neither do my teachers. I feel neglected. What used to be a 4.0 GPA is now 2.0. and it pains me (as contradictory as it may sound) to not care. Because I should care. I regret the past few years of not working hard or not trying at least, but as much as I do I don‚Äôt plan on changing. I sought help by my going to my school's psychologists which is how I ended up in therapy, but even that hasn‚Äôt helped. I don‚Äôt know what else I could possibly to do to change. I'm on the bring of mentally breaking apart and doing something drastic. With that most likely being attempting suicide.

I'm having issues coping with being alone. I read the forums for a ton of websites. I frequently lurk all over the internet and dispite all the conversations taking place and all the people I see, I have never posted.

I feel like I don't know how to talk to anybody on the internet and I don't know how to make new friends. On some occasions I've met a girl and hit it off with her, but it fails because of the same reasons... I push people away and I have an inability to become friends with her friends. I don't know how to talk to someone without freezing up. It makes getting a job terrible.

I've been to psychiatrists a lot in my life and I've worked out a lot of the issues I have but it never helped my issues with motivation and my ability to talk to others. It's actually so bad that I haven't already ended it solely because I can't get up the nerve to ask someone for help with jumping my car battery so I can drive it to a safe location.

I lost most of the friends I made in high school and the very few I still talk to on occasion are all in different cities away from me. I just don't know what to do. I can't up and move because I don't have the money for it. I have such bad work history that it's really hard to get interviews now. I have no skills and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I know it's pointless to think about, but there are countless things I wish I could take back.

how do I talk to people and make friends? Everybody I meet just thinks I'm weird. I'm not good looking, I'm not witty, I'm just a gamer/anime nerd. I've always been polite and nice and I'm really accepting I just... never hit it off with anybody

Trans women have higher amounts of testosterone than biological women, in short that makes them have a larger muscle mass and strength.

So a month or so ago I matched with someone on Tinder (19F). She said she was looking for friends as she was still healing from her past relationship. I was cool with just friends so we started talking and turns out she was abused in her past relationship. She kept emphasizing that she had no friends (she currently goes to school). I‚Äôve offered multiple times to hang out and do stuff together but she always declines. She mentioned she‚Äôs been considering suicide and I tried to discuss it with her and it ending with the fact that she‚Äôs going to see a therapist in a couple weeks. 

Fast forward to today, she sent me a picture of her and her ex that she set fire to. I again offered to meet up and she said she doesn‚Äôt feel the need to. She keeps saying that‚Äôs she‚Äôs only gonna be alive for a short time and I asked about her therapist to which she responded that they turned her away. No further details. I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs about to block me or something because she said ‚Äúgoodbye [my name].

All I know about her is her Snapchat id, Instagram id, and her snapmap location occasionally. I have no way of contacting her family or anyone.

I have been before, fortunately (I think) I made it through, and I am trying to prevent myself from getting back to that point. Throwaway because I don't want to be reminded of this if/when I make it through. 

I have been living with depression for the past 2-3 years and just this past summer I got the help I needed from the proper professionals. I was getting better with the help of meds and changes in lifestyle. Unfortunately that was a short lived and  in March of this year I attempted to end my life. I made it through and about the time I did, I met my most recent significant other. from the beginning she helped me. She knew that I had issues and problems and helped me all that she could. She was exactly what I needed at the exact time I needed it. She may very well have saved my life. On Monday out of the blue she ended things with me and I can feel myself slipping back to the state that I was in before meeting her. It's since come to light that she left me for a man 10 years younger than her.  I feel like I've failed her and myself. I can't blame her. She said that my mental health as well as the long distance relationship we were in was too hard. I know that in this case I was far too dependant on someone else for my happiness but at the time, I felt like that was my only option. I'm lost and scared and I don't want to ever go back to that because I know next time I might not be as lucky. 

I'm not interested in making amends with her or getting back together with her. If she thinks so little of me to just throw everything away like that, I know the breakup is a good thing. I just want to not feel like I felt before.

Now, I‚Äôm in 9th grade. I have a great friend group that I‚Äôve had since 8th grade and everything‚Äôs going well. In the beginning of this year in my geometry class I was trying to get to know some new kids to expand my friend circle and I met this kid, we‚Äôll call him C. He‚Äôs wicked chill, great to hang with during class, but I noticed he doesn‚Äôt have any friends in school (I get it, corona, shits difficult this year). It‚Äôs weird, because most of the people that are alone at school are weird or there‚Äôs a reason, but C is completely normal and has a ton of friends from his hometown (1 town away from me). We‚Äôve played PlayStation together for like 6 hours a day for the last few days and we‚Äôve all around hit it off

My question is, what do I do next? I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a popular kid, I‚Äôve got a bunch of friends that I‚Äôd say are about average on popularity, maybe slightly above, like I am. But C seems like he would be wicked popular if, you know, given the chance. I don‚Äôt wanna mess this up, because we‚Äôve really hit it off, but at the same time I wanna play it cautious and don‚Äôt wanna go overbearing on him. My current friend group I kind of just clicked with, but it‚Äôs different with C.

31821,"I want to make a serious attempt to kill myself for attention.I go by every day unnoticed. I have no way of expressing my suffering to people. I see other people trying to get it out on social media but nobody cares. Everyone is wrapped up in their own little world and has their own little friends that they care about.  
  
I talk to my psychiatrist, but it just leads to nihilism and more pills, more drugs, more tolerance, more overdosing just to sleep in a manner that I don't hallucinate my dead mother bleeding all over me with growths and parasites coming out of her.  
  
I need a friend. I need someone to realise that I am not okay. I need people to notice that I am getting so close to making a legitimate suicide attempt but in the meaningless of my life I am still desperate for somebody to take me seriously.  
  
I want to seriously injure myself in a way that will not physically or mentally impair me but there is that risk, but I don't care so much anymore. As long as if I mess up I am able to legitimately commit suicide afterwards.  
  
I want to do this for attention. I want to fuck myself up and send a picture of me in hospital with all of my life drained from me to someone who I know will make a public post on social media and make it look to them like I am a lot worse than I am; even though my ""suicide attempt"" will not be totally fatal.  
  
People will feel bad for never bothering to ask if I am okay. They will feel bad for not talking to me when I have made a Facebook status asking for a friend to talk to. They will feel guilty, like there is so much more they could have done. I want to then just be pumped full of enough drugs to knock me out from the pain while I disappear on Facebook and people wonder if I am even still alive.  
  
Because that's what people do. I'm not unattractive. I'm not someone that can't hold a conversation or find sexual gratification. But I'm so fucking depressed and nobody is on my wavelength. Nobody understands the anxiety and depression that plagues me every day. They know I exist but any attempt to really tell people that I'm going to die, would be brushed off with ""don't do it, you're worth more than this."" ; as they go on with their lives not thinking about me or wanting to spend time with me.  
  
This attempt will manipulate and force a mass of people to care about me. People who are feeling the same as me will finally take the time to call me and see me. I will not have to feel emotionally isolated. It won't be ""you're worth more than this, don't do it because suicide is not the answer, it will get better"" ‚Äî Because as far as they are concerned I am almost dead already, and to some extent that will be true. They won't know how to react in any other way other than caring about me.  
  
I will make friends with people I identify. I won't be sitting alone making stupid fucking Reddit posts. People I don't know, and people that used to care about me alike will come close to me and see me in an attempt to stop me from ever doing something like this ever again.  
  
Everybody else's pleas for help that fall on deaf ears will continue but I will finally have some solace and love from people through the way that I harm myself.  
  
I am currently thinking of getting a new SIM card, sending a text to someone, and the police with a suicide note and hooking up a hose from my exhaust pipe into the window of my car to render me unconscious but time it correctly so that the police find me before I lose so much oxygen that I suffer permanent brain damage. This will still fuck me up for a good week in hospital before I can start to recover.  
  
Thanks for listening Suicide Watch, even though you probably don't care just like all the people who currently don't care that I exist. Tonight I am going to find out whether I have a future with people, which they will. They will absolutely respond in masses when they see my pale white face with an exaggerated story posted in hysteria by someone else.  
  
I will finally have someone who cares.

103776,"Something to try if youre feeling down or just bored One thing to try is nofap. It's pretty self explanatory and its a really fun thing to try. It also really helps with mental health as you kind of feel like you have full control over yourself and that youre not a slave to your hand i guess. Really big sports stars went without sex for a while before big events. Ali did it and i think mike tyson did too. So yeah try it im on day 69 (lol)  and i feel much more in control of myself and i dont instantly die when i see a woman irl so yeah try it.

Another thing you can try is working out. Now I've been doing it for a long time so i know my routine might be something you might not be able to do so im gonna give you what i do and if youre starting out what you should go.

Me:i run 7.3km (i run to the park and back which is 1.68km and i do 10 laps there which is 5.5km) and i try to do it at least 3 times a weak sometimes less sometimes more but on average i do it 3 times  week.then the days when i dont run  i do some pushups (sometimes 100 sometimes more depending on how im feeling and i do them by doing 20 at once with a little break in between) then i do 6   10 second crunch holds then after six i do a 2 minute crunch hold. I dont tend to do squats because i train my legs from running.

\*Pushups work part of your back and triceps and a bit of biceps and running works all of your lower body. Crunches work your abs.\*

beginners:when i started running i tried to do 5km and i took a break after eat km but that can be too much so 3km is good too and just increase the length each time. As for pushups i started with doing 10 pushups about 3 times. try to aim for 50 but that can be a bit much. Try to stay away from situps because they are bad for your back so do crunches or the plank. Doing some squats can help too as it can increase your leg power for when you run.

The biggest factor is what you eat so eat enough food that you can still use as energy but dont eat too little id say if ur doing what i am then try to eat about 1.5k

I was blessed with some very good genes so it might take you a while to start seeing results. Also if you have been doing excercise and you cnat see results that might mean that you cant develop muscle yet so dont stop but just try to maintain your fitness so runs etc.

also if you think youre quite fit but want to get fitter then find a midway point between the 2 things i said and you should be fine

this took me a while to write and if you did take the time to try out what i said please pm me or message me on instagram: maksymilian.szyc (ill make it public so you dont have to follow me to dm me) and tell me your results and if it was any help. I consider myself very fit for a 15 yr old and i can say it does make me happy.",non-suicide
177052,"I‚Äôm struggling to hold it together yet againI posted here a few months back and things thankfully improved somewhat. But I feel like I‚Äôve taken 10 steps back once again. 

I was so amped up for the holidays. I hadn‚Äôt celebrated Christmas since 2018 and was excited. Christmas Eve I had so much fun with my mom and my boyfriend. Christmas morning was alright. 

But after opening the gifts with my boyfriend, my head just went south. I went to lay down and didn‚Äôt get up for hours. It‚Äôs like all my energy and what Christmas spirit I had just plummeted. I thought it would be a happy turning point for 2020 but it‚Äôs like my head just decided, ‚Äúno. Be sad. You know this isn‚Äôt what you wanted. You know it‚Äôs just another day. You know nothing matters anyway.‚Äù 

The day after I held it together reasonably well to spend the day after Christmas with my boyfriend and his family, but I felt miserable and sad inside. I don‚Äôt know them very well and the entire time I was a quiet, anxious mess. Truthfully, I didn‚Äôt want to go. I didn‚Äôt feel ready to meet my boyfriends sister and her fianc√©. I felt like staying home and crying but I didn‚Äôt. We had fun playing a card game. But then that night I was back home and felt just overwhelmingly sad again. I refused sex because I clearly can‚Äôt be in the mood when depressed as hell. On Sunday after I worked my morning shift for a cal center from home and my boyfriend went home, I spent all night crying. 

My birthday is Saturday and I feel directionless. I‚Äôll be 26 and feel like I‚Äôve accomplished so little. I feel like I can‚Äôt get away because of my personal responsibilities to my pets but wish I could just be alone for a few days. But at the same time I truly believe if I were alone for too long lately, I‚Äôd finally commit. Most days lately I feel like the only things keeping me tethered here are the fact my mom would be devastated and my boyfriend of almost 1 year would be sad for a while. I feel like my head is constantly under water and I can never make any momentum in life without being thrown 10 steps backward. I wish I could be on antidepressants again but I‚Äôll be losing my insurance on my birthday as that‚Äôs the cutoff for being on my moms, who was generous enough to put me back on it when I lost my job due to Covid in March. 

I simply don‚Äôt know what to do anymore and wish I could just end it all. I know of/when Covid is gone my life will never be the same. I cant handle how socially isolated I am lately and continue going back and forth between missing my friends amd people terribly and wishing I could surround myself with people again to just wanting to be alone. Craving being alone. Wishing more than anything that I could self-isolate and give up my responsibilities and not have to speak to anyone.

I choose to stay, because even though I'm not really needed here, but I still think that me leaving would somehow scar those around me. It's awful. Like I have to be here, ""just in case"", but the time I'm needed never actually comes.

I tried my best, I went out of my way to help others, just because that was the only reason for me to stay. But I'm only needed as long as there is the problem. Then they leave. I am not good for anything else, than making people feel better about themselves. And after my second attempt I honestly believed that that's enough for me to stay. At least there is some use of me being here and suffering.

But then she came, and I helped her get better. We got together, and slowly I started to believe a lie that I thought was long gone: I actually might be loved.

And honestly I don't even know why was I even expecting things to be any other way. I was born like this, an outsider even in my own life. I cannot expect anyone to stay with me. I might be simply not made for that.

I had to email my geology professor last night because this week I started having trouble finding all my assignments. This morning she emails me back saying that the reason I don't have my stuff is cuz I didn't do an exam that was due *last Sunday the 13th.*

""***Excuse me? What the hell did you just say?""*** 

An exam. I missed an exam. How the fuck am I just gonna not take an exam that I have a whole week to take. I'm pretty dumb, but I'm not that dumb. You can't make up exams. Something that is like 50% of my grade. And I'm not gonna take it? Yeah right. I email her back saying that I never got the exam. All she says to me is, ""The test was available. Sorry that you missed it."" **Bitch. I'm fucking mad.** 

Every single day I click through my classes, every single tab, to make sure that I'm not missing anything. I'm all caught up on my stuff, I check my grades, everything is fine, except I feel like I'm not doing enough work this week for geology. After she gave me my other assignment when I emailed her, the stupid exam popped up in my grades with a 0. ***MY GRADE WENT FROM A 102 TO A DAMN 80.*** I was pretty proud of my grade, happy that I'm not failing, trying to maintain my A's.

I have already become tangled in a net of people who care. Their purest wishes, for which I cannot fault them, coerce me into a life that I do not want. For if they were to stop caring, and if I could put myself where nobody would have the distress of discovering my body, I would not even hesitate.

And there is anger, because I do not want a life. I do not want to put in the effort that it would take to process myself through therapy and become a functional human being. I am not saying that it is impossible for me to be happy. I feel that if I were to co operate with such entities, and have us work together to fix myself, I would likely become happy and productive. What I am actually saying is that I do not want it. I do not want to improve myself, nor do I want to cause distress. Given that I am not willing to compromise on my wishes, there can be no movement in this. I am angry like a trapped beast, because that is what I am. So I am angry only at myself. My pitiful, weak, ridiculous self. Maybe that is the cruellest trick fate has dealt me. The weakness, neither to improve myself nor to end myself. Simply to be here as a...

...COMPLETE ASS.

But those handful of people who I have spoken to seem to think that the medical profession has some answer. They seem to think that, if I went to a doctor, they would change my mind. No, I'd have to co operate, I'd have to want to change, and I do not. All I want is something that is impossible. All I want is to fall out of existence and have nobody be sad about it.

78108,"I genuinely cannot find a reason to keep going.21 / M

This is probably going to be a wordwall, so bear with me.

It all started about 2007. I was about 11, maybe it was a year later in which case I was 12. I was a pretty popular kid. Straight A student, was friends with pretty much everyone, and even had a girl or two that had a crush on me. I was still a little depressed, but not much. I had just gotten my first cellphone, along with almost every kid in my school. It was a tracphone, or one of those services. It was a feature phone, so nothing fancy even for the time. But it was mine, so I used it proudly. I had waited until I was the age my mom made my older half-sister wait, and I had gotten it. I was happy.

Then, out of nowhere, my younger sister came home with a smartphone. She was two years younger, so long before she actually should have had a phone, let alone a smartphone. Every time I asked my mom what was going on she kept saying ""The phone is free."" Obviously it wasn't and even then I knew that wasn't true.

Then after the first month's bill came in on that phone, she immediately stopped paying for mine. I kept asking her what is up and she just gave me no reason. This, obviously, made me depressed. Most kids at school stopped talking to me, whether it was because I didn't have a phone anymore (kids are jerks) or because I was so depressed all the time, I don't know. Only two kids continued to talk to me.

Then, one day my teacher yelled at one of the students. It wasn't anything awful, but as a kid it seemed a little strange. I told my mom on the way home and she pretty much immediately pulled me out of school to be homeschooled. As a kid who was getting straight A's and was kind of bored in regular classes, but didn't make it into the advanced classes, I thought ""eh whatever this'll be better."" I was completely wrong. She barely taught me anything, which made me even more depressed than I was. Then, to make things worse, one of the two friends I had pretty much stopped talking to me because we had no way to talk anymore. The one that remained barely talked to me even then, as they got more and more into texting over phone calls.

Every time I tried to get a hobby or take part in an activity so I could actually do something with my time and make friends, I was always told we didn't have enough money. Meanwhile she spent over $100/mo on my sister's cellphone, paid probably several hundred on softball gear each year on my sister, paid God knows how much on dresses/makeup/nails/hair for her dances, plus concerts, plus football game tickets, plus at least $20 every weekend to do things with her friends. (Which became more and more as she grew older) Even when I wanted to get into wood carving, which would have cost about $30 max, I was told she didn't have enough money. Clearly she did, but I wasn't worth it.

I couldn't understand this. My sister was a complete monster all the time. She always threw fits, cussed my mother out, called her (and everyone else in the family) names, and has stolen from several family members because she thinks the world revolves around her. I was the one who did all the chores around the house. I was the one who consoled my mother when she was brought to tears by my younger sister. I was the one who brought her coffee when she got home from work. I was the one who cooked for her when I got older. I was the one who walked the dogs for her. I did literally everything for her and got nothing. Then I was always told I didn't do enough around the house. But my sister would do the dishes once and get a free pass for the next month.

My only way out of this was about 4 years ago now, back in 2013. My cousins were trying to start a live theater company in my small town in memory of my half sister, who passed away on Halloween that year, and forced me to help out. I did so begrudgingly, but I did it. It had been about 6 years of just sitting and staring at nothing all day every day, so I couldn't socialize at all. I didn't know how to have a conversation or how to act around people. I had a chance to make things better, but I couldn't because I didn't know how. There were a few people around my age, but I didn't know how to socialize with them so I couldn't actually make friends with them. 

My sister and I started studying for our licenses around the same time. She started a little bit sooner than I did, so she finished before I did. My Mom immediately gave her the only working car we had. I kept telling her it wasn't fair, but she didn't care. So, seeing as I was never going to be able to drive it, I just stopped studying for it. 

Eventually, because I didn't have a way to get places, I was included in less and less of the hanging out that went on with the people at the theater my cousins founded. Every now and then I'd get a ride, but not often.

Eventually, after having to badger my mom day in and day out, she told me the broken down car we had would be mine once my stepdad fixed it. So I started studying again. Then my sister, being the irresponsible brat she is, totaled her car and my mom gave her mine. I was completely heartbroken by this. It was pretty much my last chance to actually get moving, but she took it away. I couldn't even get a job because I had no way to get to work. Every place in walking distance wasn't hiring, My Mom worked all day, and I didn't really have any relatives that could take me. I begged and begged for months for my mom to take my car back but every time she refused, stating my sister needed it for work. More than half the time she had it, she didn't have a job. Every time I mentioned that I also need it for work, all I got was ""We'll find a way to get you"" even though this was a lie as I couldn't even get to theater things half the time.

I had to beg her for about 6-8 months to replace the car so I could do things. She finally said she would and now I have one, but I can't find a point.

4 years after starting things again, I still can't socialize at all. I have no friends. I've never had a girlfriend. I've never had a job. I missed out on the chance to do anything as a teenager. I've never been to a concert, a party, nothing. Now everyone in my family expects to just jump into being an adult, getting a job and moving out. I can't do it. 

No one cares about me. Every time I try to talk with my mom she just walks away after 5 minutes or goes to sleep. 

How can I be an adult when I didn't even get to be a teenager? Every kid my age is in college now, hours away. Even if they were here, I wouldn't be able to make friends with them. All I can do is stand around awkwardly as other people have conversations. I can't really even chime in. 

There's no point in living anymore. I'm going to end up miserable for the rest of my life. Every time I see pictures of people's kids going to dances, or hear people talk about when they were teenagers, I start crying and want to end my life. I didn't even get a chance to do any of that. Why? Because my own mother would rather spoil my sister than give me a fair shot at life.

I never get a chance to be a teenager again. None of these problems will ever be fixed. I just don't want to be alive anymore. After telling my mom all of this again and again, all she can offer up is a half sincere ""Sorry. I shouldn't have done that. Things will get better."" No, they won't. I've been trying for 4 years and they've only gotten worse.

(i hate slurs) i hate the way my family yells at me when 
my family doesn‚Äôt believe in therapy or anything like it and think forcing information out of a person and trying to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù them will work.

I've tried to live my life as a proud lesbian, but I am living a lie. I should have been born male. It becomes harder to look at myself every day. Everything about my body feels so wrong: the hips, the tits, my goddamn thighs, my short stature. My girlfriend will leave me if I make any attempt to transition, or if I even come out. She is the only thing keeping me going these days. I will be completely friendless. My friends in the lesbian community hate transgender people and if I transitioned it would be a betrayal of everything they believe in.

The last thing my mother said to me was that her daughter is already dead to her, and now she is just waiting for the day she'll be allowed to bury me.

Ive been off my meds for a while now I just cant bring myself to actually take them so now i get to enjoy what me being a fucking idiot has brought upon me. Im really scared and alone I dont know what to do its so late and I cant call anyone. I already stabbed my arm kinda deep and it was bleeding a lot but its sort of calmed down now.

305261,"Please Help Me UnderstandEverything seems pointless. I am doing well in two online courses to finish an associates degree to have something to my name, then maybe go on to a bachelor's with my saved money. The only thing stopping me is not knowing the major I want to choose - I don't want it to be a waste of money. I currently have a job that I don't mind going to and the people there are good. I often don't mind staying late to help. I have more than good relations with all my family members that I keep in touch with often. I have good friends that I know are there for me. I have people ask me out sometimes, which is flattering but I don't want a relationship - I guess I've never really wanted one. I don't feel close to anyone. I've tried a couple. I didn't see a future with them so I didn't want to string them along. Relationships and most everything is predictable, I just got tired of them and would've rather had them as a friend. I go out often. I meet up with family members often for meals. I'm the initiater and planner when I go out with a friend or group of friends (to mainly just  keep busy and stay in touch with them) - like board game nights, karaoke, pick up sports games, bowling, swimming, ect. I don't have any social media except for Facebook. I only go through about 1gb of data a month. I'm almost never on my phone. I do things on my own - like right now I am learning how to juggle, just doing it a couple minutes a day and I'm getting better everyday. I am messing around on the keyboard and acoustic guitar for a couple minutes to an hour a couple times a week. I take my dog to the dog park when I can and walk him around my neighborhood often - I often listen and focus on my surroundings on these walks and even just in general I do this all the time. I posses an array of narcotics. I never really enjoyed drugs, I just did them with other people for the experience and it was like an event planned to 'trip' or get high or whatever. I don't see myself taking them in the future anymore, even with other people. I think I'm going to throw them all away or give them away. I stopped vigorously exercising and became lenient with my exercise. I used to be religious about my workout routines. On my own right now I am actually on a liquid diet called Soylent (I eat all kinds of different foods when I'm with other people). It saves me money and stress about what to eat and helps me not eat excess calories on this meal plan. I just went to the doctor for a physical and he said my blood tests all came back normal and I'm at a healthy weight and good blood pressure. I am healthy.


But I have this underlying thought of wanting to just go away. Like my soul wants to be released from my body. I want freedom, ultimate freedom. I don't want to continue living. I know how to feel happy and sad and everything in between. I know what failure is like and I know what success feels like. There's no point anymore. I am doing things but in the middle of it, I often have this thought of ""I'm okay if I died at this very moment."" I actually often get this feeling when I'm in a more happy and elated state - I want to die happy. I was just talking with a friend and they asked me: ""what do you want do with your life?"" I couldn't answer. I actually shut down. I just said I don't know and stopped talking and answering their questions and stared into space. They changed the subject after silence. It was as if they exposed my desire of just wanting to die, but of course I didn't want to tell them that. I was put on the spot because what I want to do with my life is end it. I'm capable of doing anything, but I can't do everything. I'm not hopeless. I know I have potential for this world. I can help people but I feel people mostly take advantage and have ulterior motives for any relationship, I know it's not everyone. I just don't know what to do, I do almost everything. Jack of all trades, still learning everything I can from anyone or anything and trying everything and open to anything. I took dialectal behavioral therapy. I know how to be mindful and often use those skills to come back in the middle when my emotions become overwhelming for me. I'm seeeing a counselor but we just talk about stuff I do during the week. She's just another person trying to help another person, it's just her job. Maybe she's not the right professional councilor for me but I enjoy talking to her. My mother wants me to be on medication again because she knows I have these thoughts, often. I used to be prescribed but I don't want that, I don't want to not feel again. I don't want any substances. I don't think they're bad, I think a lot of people benefit from them, I personally just don't feel like I want to be in an altered state of mind. I don't get it. I'm doing things, trying new things, constantly meeting people, even moving states again soon for a job. Things are, per say, ""good"" in the eyes of everyone. But it's like I want release. It's like I'm just tired. Tired of living. I don't see a future for myself. But I'm not hopeless, I know I have potential. I just don't want to do anything anymore, I want death. Everything is just meaningles, irrelevant, unnecessary, ect to me. I don't know why I have these feelings when I'm doing all these things. They are always there. But I have this feeling that the end is near. I want release from this expected life that I feel that I can already foresee (get married or not; have kids or not; employed or unemployed; what everyone else is doing and living). Like I said, most everything is predictable and turn out the way I expected in my mind. I've had these thoughts since I was little but they're occurring more and becoming increasingly prominent in my thoughts as I get older. I know how to feel, I'm just tired of this loop. It's like the only thing that interests me is death. I don't know why I desire death.",suicide

I was already feeling down because I hate waking up every morning to go to the hospital and coming home to study and sleeping late and repeating every day until the weekend, which gets consumed by assignments and more study.

Wow, THREE DAYS! That's insane! As always, if you have any questions or topics for me, let me know in the comments. I'll see you tomorrow!  


Fact: Let's talk a little bit about Saturn's lesser-known moons. As cool as they are, Titan, Enceladus, and Iapetus can't get all the attention! There are 4 of them I want to give some info on, so I'm not going to waste your time here. Let's dive right in!

&amp;#x200B;

Dione: The first moon here is Dione, which - like most moons - is tidally locked to its parent planet. However, there's something odd about the way Dione is tidally locked. The side of Dione that faces Saturn has fewer craters than the side that doesn't face Saturn. This is the exact opposite of what many scientists were expecting, and it could indicate that - at some point in the past - a massive impact may have caused Dione's orientation to completely reverse!

&amp;#x200B;

Mimas: This is my third favorite Saturnian moon, and it's all because of one feature named Herschel Crater. To put it simply, it's a massive crater likely made by an impact that nearly obliterated Mimas. It's so big that it makes Mimas look like the Death Star from *Star Wars!*

&amp;#x200B;

Rhea: Back in 2008, NASA announced that observations from the *Cassini* probe suggested that Rhea could have a very small ring system! This would have marked the first time that any moon was known to have rings, but further *Cassini* observations unfortunately revealed no evidence of ring material.

&amp;#x200B;

Tethys: Our final moon here is Tethys, which is 97% as dense as liquid water. This suggests that the moon may be almost entirely made of water ice!  


The Saturnian moons are super interesting, and I loved doing this fact about them because they all have their own little quirks!",non-suicide

75114,"Here's how and why I'm gonna kill myself over money 

It's just that even if I magically got over depression, ptsd, panic disorder, anxiety, and psychosis my life would still be fucked up beyond repair. I'm tens and tens of thousands in debt and I'm only 22. It's been this way since I dropped out of college and then went to the hospital for a past suicide attempt. So now I have absolutely crushing debt from student loans, medical costs from the hospital, along with credit card debt because I'm an impulsive irresponsible idiot. My credit is sub-400 because so much of this has gone into collections and I haven't been able to keep up with payments. I eat on like $1 a day, have a cheap phone plan, a shitty car that needs so many repairs it could die at any second, live with abusive alcoholic parents because It's at least rent-free even though the abuse is intolerable, and work as much overtime as I can at the job I hate on top of giving plasma twice a week and it still isn't enough. By the time I make even 3/4 of my payments I have and pay for food and gas to get to work and back I have basically no money for anything including saving. That's working as much as I can and giving plasma and not a penny into savings and it still isn't enough, and other things just become more and more delinquent in collections so my credit only gets worse and worse. Some of these things I'm only even making interest payments so I'm literally making no progress whatsoever on the actual debt.

I can't move out of my abusive, disgusting house (pet waste, pests and mold *everywhere*) with parents who are drunk 7 days a week 52 weeks a year. Even working my absolute hardest at a job that I hate but the pay is ok and I can work overtime and plasma isn't enough. I can do literally nothing.

Even if I weren't depressed this would be a horrible horrible existence and that's the thing people don't get. It's not even about the mental illness anymore. Yes I'm taking meds and seeing a therapist and psychiatrist and have for 7 years but none of it has ever done a thing. I've done the works, every lifestyle change and med and therapist and group and therapy type and everything short of ECT or ketamine because I can't afford them and none of it has ever done a thing.

But! Even if it did, even if i was mentally healthy, my life would be absolutely awful. I can't live like this. I don't think anyone should. If someone described this life to me even if they didn't have a diagnosed mental illness I'd understand if they didn't wanna live. This isn't unreasonable or crazy. It isn't ""just money."" Money *does* buy happiness for some people and I'm one. I could move out from my horrible house, not work the shit job I hate and focus on doing things I enjoy and that heal me, I could afford more treatment options, I could travel, try to get back on track to going to college again, I could visit the couple friends I have who live far away etc. It all comes down to money. That's it. My happiness is dependent on money and I can't get it and won't get it. This is realistically the best paying job i'll get right now and I'm working OT and supplementing my income and it can't even touch my needs. Even bankruptcy wouldn't help because a big majority of my debt is student loans.

Just cruel. It's funny in the darkest way. Money is so arbitrary and it's what I'm gonna kill myself over. A social construct is gonna kill me. And if I had just had a better dice roll at birth I'd be completely fine. If I had just been born to rich parents like so many are I wouldn't have to die and could live a fulfilling life, but the way my life actually is I can't. It's impossible, I've tried everything. I've even very very seriously considered escaping my debt by moving to another country but it would be way too expensive upfront, even just a one-way plane ticket would be way too much. They say suicide is a last resort but it's like yeah obviously. Nobody stubs their toe or gets a hangnail and suddenly kills themselves over it with nothing else going on. I am using it as a last resort. I've tried literally everything else. Everything I can try, I tried and it didn't work. So this is all that's left.

I was never a good kid, but when I was 7 my parents got divorced, and my best friend moved. This crushed me. For the next few years of my life I stopped hanging out with the friends I had and only played on my computer. I'm a complete asshole to people. I have ADD and probably Asperger's. My mom would help me do assignments until 2nd grade when she said enough was enough. I wouldn't do them at all. For being a bad student and person I was bullied. The teachers also bullied me, I went to catholic school. They said things such as ""You don't deserve to be Christian"". When I forgot a pencil for a test and asked for one from a classmate I was accused of cheating. When I read ahead in class the teacher screamed at me for not reading, when I tried to defend my claim she said don't talk back. This was in second grade and I had nightmares about it. This wasn't without cause, I would forget things, not do my work, I didn't have any friends. The one friend I did have  I made fun of and betrayed for attention, like I said im an utter trash of a human being. This was in 3rd grade. In 4th grade I stole money from my parents just to make friends the only way I knew I could. In 4th grade I also joined a group of Nazi supporters, I just wanted friends. They later kicked me out and I begged to rejoin them. I spent years more on video games just to ease the pain, not on the shooters all the popular kids were playing, because my mom said I could never play them. I couldn't have people come over to my house, as my mom hoards things and its a mess. I'm a lot of the problem though. I treat my mom like shit. Ever since I can remember I would never have anything good to say. Always a mean comment, always dissatisfied, I don't know why I'm like this. I'm hurting her even though she only wants the best for me, ive been a hell of a child. I'm never happy, never have been nd can only remember some moments of being happy before I was 7. In 5th grade I went to another catholic school because of the bullying. I because an alter server for the parish of the original school, I hate the priests, I will never forget them for their inaction. when I was 10 I had nightmares of them taking me to the principle and her beating me. My mom tried to make things better but they never were. The catholic school in 5th grade the kids cared but I was a bad student in person. I also don't fit in. All of them talked on I message, I didn't have a phone because it was bad for me to have one. I didn't have Jordan's because well, my mom said that they are not leather. I was a terrible student. I bullied a black girl for attention (I later reconciled with her). I hailed Hitler for attention. Anything I could do for attention, to make fiends, to get noticed, something. I never did my work and played games or watched tv. This also added to my moms stress. I have ADD, so the need for attention nd struggle with work makes more sense now. I'm now 16 and in public school. I still act like an asshole to my mom and don't have a single good thing to say, I don't know why I act like this. Realizing how much of a wreck life has been I decided to kill myself. On mothers day I wanted to do something special for my mom, but i fucked it up. She woke me p with a 40min prayer for forgiveness. Because of my experience in catholic school I hate prayer and God and she knows this. I refused to pray,  said hail Satan, and that's how I ruined her mothers day. She is a devout Catholic. I wish i could change my childhood, I really do. It went wrong at every step, some of it was me and my fucked up brain, and some of it was out of my control. I want to say sorry to my mom for acting like an asshole all my life. I'd like to say sorry to the people I bullied and wronged, I just wanted attention and friends, not to hurt someone. I' really sorry to my Grandmother, she lived through WWII and went to a concentration camp, I can't bear the fact she knew what I had done with supporting Nazi things. I loved her more than anyone else in my life (she had been dead for a few years). My mom tried to get me therapy but I lied and said everything is fine. I've wanted to kill myself since I was 9. I never got permanent help or therapy, just some sporadic events. I've never harmed myself, I cant take the pain. But I also cant take the pain of life any longer. I don't see things chaining for the better and I can never forget what I've done to myself. Goodbye and I'm sorry to the people whom I've harmed.

168080,"I want romance. I want a wedding. But no one could ever love me that way.I know this is ridiculous. It seems everyone has been having dream weddings lately, and they‚Äôre always such beautiful people. I‚Äôm jealous. It makes me feel like life just isn‚Äôt worth it.

It feels impossible that I‚Äôll ever fall in love and get married with the right person.

My boyfriend is an asshole and doesn‚Äôt have an ounce of empathy/selflessness, and it‚Äôs been bringing me down horribly.

He never takes me out on dates. He never says anything encouraging. He never does anything romantic for me.

Will I ever have it? Why do I want to have a romantic relationship, filled with love and care so much? Why do I want the flowers? Why do I want to hold hands? Why do I want all these couple-y things?

But it‚Äôs unobtainable. I‚Äôve never been interested in anyone that asks me out, except for my current boyfriend, but the honeymoon phase is over, and now he‚Äôs showing his true colors of being an apathetic, unmotivated, bitter jerk.

I used to think he was perfect. We had so much fun, and he would do those romantic things for me. But it‚Äôs just ‚Äúnot him‚Äù, and that was only a side effect of the honeymoon phase.

Maybe I‚Äôm speaking out of emotion right now.

I can‚Äôt relate to the rest of society. I feel too deep. I‚Äôm fragile. People only ask me out because I‚Äôm decent looking. I‚Äôm a pushover. I care too much. I‚Äôve always gone above and beyond for the people I love. 

No one will ever love me to that extent.",suicide

209196,"Knowing people care about me is the only thing stopping meI just keep struggling with a desire to live, or even do anything. I still find enjoyment in stuff, I get my school done, I kind of take care of myself.

I just keep going up and down rapidly, almost in an instant sometimes, and the worst part is I've made multiple plans, ways to try and die remotely enough I can't be found. 

Then I think about that even if I simply disappeared, I'd leave an awful note in people's lives. I haven't managed to find any reassurance in this lately. I just get mad. I'm hundreds of miles from the people who can help me, and they don't even know anyways. I simultaneously won't do it because I know they care, but at the same time I'm getting no meaningful of helpful social interactions.

I'm sorry if this was rambly or jumped around a bit, but I'm not in the right place to make sure I write right. Thanks for letting me vent.",suicide

67404,"No more hopeI just found out today that I‚Äôll need to schedule an appointment with my primary doctor to be recommended to a specialist for a possible rectal prolasping, or hemorrhages or whatever it is. It just isn‚Äôt normal and now it‚Äôs a big concern. I‚Äôm young and already struggling so much like everybody else. I was homeless from 17 until this year (now 22) and I already have to find another place to live before March. I have shitty health insurance that only lasts until the end of the year I think. I already have bad dental issues I‚Äôm trying to take care of and my appointment is before my birthday. That‚Äôs already gonna cost me so much money, and now with the asshole issues I‚Äôm just spiraling. I got a new server job that I don‚Äôt even want and haven‚Äôt really started yet because I‚Äôve been sick and am getting a Covid test. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Covid, but you can‚Äôt be too safe these days in 2020. I‚Äôm so tired of struggling. I‚Äôve had to sacrifice my mental health for other more important priorities like making sure I can eat once a day is my eating disorder will allow me. I‚Äôm pretty sure my nana doesn‚Äôt have much time left either and know that‚Äôll be coming soon enough. I don‚Äôt have any family besides my mom and her. My mom has her own sad story snd can‚Äôt even help me besides emotional support, and I feel so damn guilty over that already. What‚Äôs the point in anything anymore? Any light that has been in my life felt as if its all been ripped away from me. I feel another attempt again, and it‚Äôs been 4 years since I‚Äôve failed last time. I know I‚Äôd rather go through with succeeding to kill myself than to ever go back to any psych ward. I‚Äôve wanted to attempt to kill myself the entire 3 weeks I was in there and quickly go out due to faking being better. Everything costs so much money that only less than 5% of people have and there‚Äôs nothing that would make anything better. I‚Äôm sorry that it might seem selfish only thinking about myself. I just can‚Äôt fight this anymore. There‚Äôs no hope left. There hasn‚Äôt been for a long time.",suicide
